# Net Authority

This code was used to run the first incarnation of NetAuthority.org back in 2001. I've made the code available here for historical purposes in case anyone is curious. The code is terrible. You have been warned.

See [this blog post](https://codeword.xyz/2017/03/15/that-time-i-trolled-the-entire-internet/) for a bit more information about what Net Authority was.
