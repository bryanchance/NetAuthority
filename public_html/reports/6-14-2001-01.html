<!--#include virtual="../exec/header.pl?Net Authority Website Operational"--><P CLASS="title">Net Authority Website Operational</P><P CLASS="italic">Jun 14, 2001</P><P>Long standing Internet authority group "Net Authority" has recently announced the opening of their public website. Behind the scenes, this group has aided in the eventual conviction of hundreds of child pornographers, molesters, and other criminals who use the internet as a tool in their crimes. The new webpage includes a set of guidelines, called the "Net Authority Acceptable Internet Usage Guidelines," or NA-AIUG. These guildelines detail specifically what is considered unacceptable material for distribution over the internet.</P><P>The website also has a page on which Internet users may report people who are in violation of the NA-AIUG. This brilliant utility on the site allows for the already hugely comprehensive offender databases maintained by Net Authority to grow even faster. Soon every person who has ever been involved with offensive material on the Internet will be listed in the Net Authority databases.</P><P>When asked to comment on how they feel the new website will affect Net Authority's ability to help clean up the Internet, they replied "...we feel that the new website will be an invaluable tool in our mission."</P><P>The website has already reported over 2 million visitors in just the first week of operation. Hopefully this is a sign that the Internet will finally take larger steps towards "cleaning up its act" in the near future.</P><!--#include file="footer.html"-->
