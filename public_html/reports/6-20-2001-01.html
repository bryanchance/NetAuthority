Much of the content was replaced with vulgar comments and vandalized copies of the site's original images.</P><P>When asked to comment, Net Authority stated that they are currently working with federal authorities to help bring the perpetrator to justice. They claimed to already have several leads, and believed the whole situation would be wrapped up in a matter of days.</P><P>Net Authority has sparked much controversy since the inception of it's website, despite the fact that the organization has been around for several years already. The response their net presence has shown is only more proof that the Internet must be regulated more thouroughly in order for people to be safe.</P><!--#include file="footer.html"-->
