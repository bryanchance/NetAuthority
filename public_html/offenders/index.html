You are here because you know of someone who may have violated the <a href="guidelines.html">Net Authority Acceptable Internet Usage Guidelines</a>. You are just a few short steps away from adding the offender to our databases. Please use the following links to move on to the appropriate form, or read the sections below for more information.</P><P CLASS="subtitle">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="offenders/known.html">I know of an offender who has violated the NA-AIUG</a><BR>&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="offenders/suspect.html">I suspect someone I know may have violated the NA-AIUG</a></P><P CLASS="subtitle">Why Should I Report Offenders?</P><P>Reporting offenders to us is a very important process that all Internet users should take very seriously. The Internet is a place where our children go to be entertained and educated. It is imperative that we do our best to remove all material that can corrupt young minds from public access on the internet. The only way to do this is by removing their source -- the people who put the corrupting materials on the internet in the first place. By maintaining an up to date database of all known Internet offenders, Net Authority is able to help put an end to the distribution of offensive materials on the Internet. Our goal is a much cleaner, friendlier, and overall more effective Internet for the children of tomorrow. You can help make the Internet of the future the Internet of today!</P><P CLASS="subtitle">How Do I Recognize An Offender?</P><P>Internet offenders are surprisingly easy to identify. The simplest way is to look at their website, or the contents of their computer. If you do so and find material that is in violation of the <a href="guidelines.html">Net Authority Acceptable Internet Usage Guidelines</a>, then you know that the individual is an offender and must be immediately added to our databases.</P><P>If the individual does not have a webpage, or you do not have access to their computer, there are other signs that indicate the person is an offender. People who spend a lot of time on their computers connected to the internet are often offenders. Especially if these people become moody or angry when you confront them about how much time they spend on the Internet. Often the best way to tell if someone is an offender is by observing their response when you outright ask them: "Are you looking at offensive materials on the Internet?"</P><P>If you are still unsure if the person is an offender, we have devised a simple <a href="offenders/suspect.html">questionnaire</a> for you to fill out. Your answers to these questions will allow our sophisticated algorithms to determine if the individual in question is, in fact, an Internet offender. If it is determined that they are, then the person is added automatically to the appropriate databases.</P><P CLASS="subtitle">Will The Person Know I Added Them?</P><P>No. Individuals who are added to the databases are informed of their current status as an offender, however all details of who added them to the databases remains confidential. There is no way for anyone to trace the origin of the person who added them to the databases.</P><!--#include file="footer.html"-->
