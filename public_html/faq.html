<P CLASS="title">Frequently Asked Questions</P>

<P>Often we get emails asking us questions about Net Authority; what we do, who we are, and so forth. In order to make life a little easier for everyone, we have composed this list of questions that people frequently ask us along with our answers. Should you wish to have further clarification on the issues below, feel free to send your request to <a href="mailto:info@netauthority.org">info@netauthority.org</a>.</P>

<P CLASS="italic">NOTE: Questions regarding offenders and how to recognize and report them are detailed on the <a href="offenders/">Report Offenders</a> page.</P>

<P CLASS="subtitle">How does it feel to be providing the community with such a wonderful service?</P>

<P>We are happy to be playing a leading role in the task of cleaning up the Internet. However, all of us feel that what we do is not something we should be singled out and praised for. It is the people out there who support our cause that should be praised. After all, what is a shepherd without his sheep?</P>

<P CLASS="subtitle">Have you ever successfully brought an offender to justice?</P>

<P>We have aided law enforcement agencies in the tracking, capture, and conviction of Internet criminals on several occasions.</P>

<P CLASS="subtitle">Do people ever get wrongfully added to your databases?</P>

<P>One complaint that people often have with us is that they were added to our databases in error. We have come to the conclusion that this is rarely the case.</P>

<P>People often claim that they were added by their friends as a practical joke. Now, consider this scenario. A young man, let's call him Ray, notices that his friend, let's call her Jody, has been acting a little strange. She is much more aloof around family and friends, and she has been spending a lot more time at the computer. These are clear, tell-tale signs that Jody is exploring illegal pornography on the Internet. Out of fear for the safety of both Jody, and the Internet as a whole, Ray reports Jody as an offender and she is added to our database.</P>

<P>Imagine now that Jody discovers that Ray has added her. She confronts him, and what does he say? Out of the fear that she may get angry, and possibly violent with him, he says he added her as a practical joke. You see? Even though Ray added Jody to the database out of genuine concern for the Internet, Jody has been led to believe it was simply a practical joke.</P>

<P CLASS="subtitle">How can I help clean up the Internet?</P>

<P>You can help in a lot of ways. First of all, be sure to familiarize yourself with the <a href="guidelines.html">Net Authority Acceptable Internet Usage Guidelines</a>. Then be sure to <a href="offenders/">report</a> all offenders you find on the internet. Offenders can be the webmasters of offensive websites, people who visit these websites for any reason other than to report them to us, or people who support the breaching of the guidelines in any way.</P>

<P>Net Authority does not accept donations any more.</P>

<P CLASS="subtitle">Can I link to Net Authority from my web page? Will you add a link to my webpage?</P>

<P>You may link to Net Authority from your webpage only if your page completely obeys the <a href="guidelines.html">NA-AIUG</a>. Net Authority does not link to external websites.</P>
