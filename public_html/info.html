<!--#include virtual="exec/header.pl?About Net Authority"--><P CLASS="title">What is Net Authority?</P><P>The Net Authority is a group of individuals who have taken it upon themselves to govern the Internet. We have waited patiently and in vain for the World's governments to put their resources together and develop a standard set of guildelines for what material should be permitted on the Internet, and what should not. We have prayed without answer for a centralized agency with the power and the means to stop crimes against humanity on the Internet. The time for waiting has ended. Clearly we, the people, must take matters into our own hands. Net Authority writes those guidelines. Net Authority is that agency.</P><P CLASS="subtitle">The Guidelines</P><P>Net Authority's primary function is to devise and maintain a set of standards for Internet material. These standards clearly lay out what is and is not acceptable material for public distribution over the Internet. The purpose of the standards is to eventually replace today's filth and smut ridden Internet with the cleaner, healthier, and overall more effective Internet of tomorrow.</P><P>The <a href="guidelines.html">Net Authority Acceptable Internet Usage Guidelines</a> (<a href="guidelines.html">NA-AIUG</a>) are based solely on the desirable morals of civilized society. Their basic effect is to simply organize and prioritize all that is blasphemous in the eyes of God. It is only natural for one of the tools of His creation to be adapted and molded into a form that He finds acceptable. Net Authority merely acts as a catalyst for that process.</P><P>If you wish to read the Net <a href="guidelines.html">Authority Acceptable Internet Usage Guidelines</a>, please <a href="guidelines.html">click here</a>.</P><P CLASS="subtitle">Policing</P><P>Any set of guidelines is useless without some way to enforce the standards that they detail. Net Authority recognizes this fact and has thus put together a team of policy enforcers. Primarily through use of the written word, the Net Authority Police enforce and punish those who disobey the standards set forth in the <a href="guidelines.html">Net Authority Acceptable Internet Usage Guidelines</a>. While we may not yet have any legal power to back our enforcement of the <a href="guidelines.html">NA-AIUG</a>, our cause is justified in the eyes of God, which gives us all the authority we desire.</P><P>On occasion, Net Authority teams up with local law enforcement agencies in order to physically eliminate material in breach of the NA-AIUG. After these events, Net Authority retains the offending materials and their media, while the perpetrator remains in the custody of said local law enforcement agency. The media containing the offending materials is then quickly disposed of by means that render the media, and thus all content, unusable.</P><P CLASS="subtitle">Other Services</P><P>Net Authority is also the leading source of Internet offender tracking. We maintain several large <a href="database.html">databases</a> of the names and personal information of individuals who have breached the <a href="guidelines.html">NA-AIUG</a>. These <a href="database.html">databases</a> are continually updated and maintained in preparation for when Net Authority gains the legal means to prosecute and punish these individuals. Our <a href="database.html">databases</a> are the largest and most accurate of their kind in existence, as they rely on the Internet population as a whole to keep them up to date.</P><P>For more information on our <a href="database.html">databases</a>, please <a href="database.html">click here</a>.</P><P>In these times of widespread chaos and blatant defiance of our Lord, we must work together. With our help and yours, the Internet can become a much safer, more enjoyable, and friendly environment to work in.</P><!--#include file="footer.html"-->
