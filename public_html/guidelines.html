<P CLASS="title">Net Authority Acceptable Internet Usage Guidelines</P>

<P>These guidelines are broken up into seven distinct sections. Each section goes into detail on the materials considered unacceptable and/or immoral for public distribution or viewing on the Internet. Read these guidelines carefully, for if you violate them you risk being added to the Net Authority <a href="database.html">databases</a> as an Internet crime offender.</P>

<P>Further clarification on any of the points below may be obtained by emailing <a href="mailto:info@netauthority.org">info@netauthority.org</a>.</P>

<P>The following material is, without question, unacceptable for public distribution or viewing on the Internet:</P>

<P CLASS="subtitle">Hate Literature</P>

<P>Hate literature entails any media that indicates, direct or implied, one group of persons' superiority over another. This includes, but is not limited to, written material, photographs, rendered images, and multimedia presentations. The groups can be categorized by race, religious beliefs, skin color, association, or any delimiter that specifies distinct separation of on group of persons from another. If you distrubite, read, aid in the digital transfer of, or are related in any way to hate literature as defined above, you are in violation of the NA-AIUG.</P>

<P CLASS="subtitle">Pornography</P>

<P>Pornographic material is any material that condones, either directly or implied, the human body as an item of sexual desire. This includes but is not limited to, written material, photographs, rendered images, and multimedia presentations. Either utilizing the human body as an item to induce sexual desire, or experiencing sexual desire for the human body as a direct result of using the Internet, puts you in violation of the NA-AIUG.</P>

<P CLASS="subtitle">Child Pornography</P>

<P>Child pornography is a particularly depraved form of pornography (see definition above) that adds the following stipulation: the human body inducing sexual desire is that of a minor (a human of 17 years of age or less). Using the Internet to either distribute or obtain child pornography puts you in violation of the NA-AIUG.</P>

<P CLASS="subtitle">Bestiality</P>

<P>Bestiality is another relatively depraved and vile form of pornography (see definition above). The stipulation added is as follows: the body inducing sexual desire is that of an animal. This includes the use of the human body and an animal's body at the same time to induce sexual desire. Using the Internet to either distribute or obtain bestiality related material puts you in violation of the NA-AIUG.</P>

<P CLASS="subtitle">Homosexual Pornography</P>

<P>Homosexual pornography is a form of pornography (see definition above) in which the use of two or more human bodies of the same gender are used to induce sexual desire. This is a blatant defiance of God's good intentions for his creation, and the involvement with such material over the Internet not only puts you in violation of the NA-AIUG, but also makes you a sinner in the eyes of our Lord.</P>

<P CLASS="subtitle">Interracial Pornography</P>

<P>Interracial pornography is another form of pornography (see definition above) which adds this stipulation: either there are more than one human bodies of differing racial descent inducing sexual desire, or the human body inducing sexual desire is of differing racial descent of the person in whom the desire is being induced. Distributing, viewing, aiding in the digital transfer of, or being involved in any way with interracial pornography on the Internet puts you in violation of the NA-AIUG.</P>

<P CLASS="subtitle">General Blasphemy</P>

<P>Blasphemic content is any material that is seen as sin through the eyes of our Lord. It is expected that all Internet users familiarize themselves with The Bible. Ignorance is no excuse! If you are involved with the distribution of, or obtain in any fashion material that is considered offensive, then you are in violation of the NA-AIUG.</P>
