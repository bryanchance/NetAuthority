<P>Interesting notion. But yet, it's obviously racist and homophobic: which I find an intreaguing notion. Would that make the unholy mating of my white father and asian mother a sin?I'm sure you'll add me to your 'hate list'... would it not be a hate list? After all, your tactics do bring to mind the communist scare way back when.
<P>The fact that you don't offer any evidence of what pages you've targeted amuses me, nor give evidence of who squealed about them. Why, you have not a shred of credibility as to why you deserve the role of Internet Police, oh Administrator.
<P>I look foward to you, oh mysterious leader of this page, targeting me for your next internet target. I'm sure you will.
