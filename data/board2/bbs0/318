<P>the people who post message PRO_N(AZI)ET-AUTHORITY
<BR>don't leave their e-mail addresses?... because they're afraid that they'll get flamed, or is it because they are the "Admins"..
<P>There is the chance that this post is so filled with sarcasm that i can't see it but i'm more inclined to reguard anyone who doesn't even post a fake address as a pussy..
