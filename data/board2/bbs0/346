<P>Ok, so on one hand we have a website that, even when compared to hypocritical, conservative Christian blasphemy such as <A HREF="http://www.godhatesfags.com">www.godhatesfags.com</A>, is completely ludicrous in its arrogance and obviously xenophobic attitude. Based on that observation alone, one might count it as subtle satire. When when you take into account the claim that this small group of radicals are going to supercede the U.S. government and cleanse the internet of legal pornography and "general blasphemy," though, it seems obvious that these people either do not understand the scope of the web today, or that this is some bored-ass liberal's idea of a personal joke. And yes, it does look like that girl in the middle of the choir is giving us the "rock on" sign.
<P>On the other hand: why? Who would waste their time on something that has no point, and no punchline? It would take somebody with a very odd sense of humor indeed to think that all the work that went into this webpage would be worth a few chuckles and maybe some hatemail (and its doubtful that these people had any idea how many people would find their way into this forum.) Effective satire entails at least SOME form of irony, and all the things ironic and paradoxical about this webpage are universal to most- if not all- Southern Baptist literature. So basically if its real, they're idiots; if its a joke, they're morons; and either way, they've got way too much spare time. Thoughts?
