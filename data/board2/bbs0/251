<P>again, stop with the typos. netauth is not helping the children, it is angering us.
<BR>we want to help kids, but not all kids are chritian. kids dont give a fuck about the bible and thats good, look how much suffering religion has caused. also, it is the parents job to make sure kids dont look at anything not suited for them. don't take away parents' rights, look how much damage netauth has done.

<BR>2) trying to take away the parents' rights to raise their own kids
