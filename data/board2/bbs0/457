<P>The offending site is yours. Have you seen your forum ? There are lewd \ racial \ pornographic comments in it - talk about hypocracy.
<BR>BTW - I presume you are using some form of site scanner to look for words that match your 'lewd' criteria. You may wanna check cos any site in sCUNThorpe will register, as will many other totally unoffending words
<BR>
