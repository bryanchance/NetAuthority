<P>yes, jesus! please let your unwielding hand of assimilation and conformity wipe clean all that which gives pleasure! almighty god, let your word crush with impunity any and all beliefs or moral standards that may contradict with your own! we cannot allow people of opposing thought to run free! strike fear into thine hearts, sweet jesus, for those who oppose you will certainly rot in hell for their sins against thy name!
<P>'an angel of the lord came unto me,
<BR>snatched me up from my place of slumber...
<BR>and took me on high!
<BR>and higher still till we both be betwixt the air itself!
<BR>and we proceeded to the farmlands of our own midwest,
<BR>where cries of pending doom ROSE from the soil!
<BR>one thousand, nay, a million voices full of fear!
<BR>and terror possessed me then...
<BR>and i begged,
<BR>"angel of the lord, what ARE these tortured screams?"
<BR>and the angel said unto me
<BR>"these...are the cries of the carrots. the cries of the carrots...you see, reverend maynard, tomorrow is harvest day and them....it is...the holocaust!'
<BR>and i sprang from my slumber drenched in sweat with the fears of one million TERRIFIED brothers...and roared...
<BR>"hear me now! i've seen the light! they have a consciousness! they have a life! they have a soul! DAMN YOU! let...the rabbits wear glasses...save our brothers, can i get an amen? can i get a hallelujah? thank you jesus....'
<P>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
<BR>you massive compendium of jackasses. christians never cease to make their ignorance and stupidity so unbelievably clear. good luck in your crusade. i'll think of you while i jerk off tonite.
