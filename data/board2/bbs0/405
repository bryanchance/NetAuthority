<P>Now lets think about this. What do you actually people actaully do? Do you for 1 second belive that this site will help anybodys life in a positive way. (besides that is makes me laugh) Don't know the answer? Than think about this. What are you people actaully doing? Hmmmm i see the put down of pornography and blashphemy, the one sidedness of trying to say "all people should be familar with the bible", and worst of all a the absolute stupidy of thinking what you're doing is good. The internet is the way its is for a reason. And that reason is is that its how the majority likes it. If you took a poll of every internet user on earth tell me do you think the MAJORITY would agree with what you're doing? I see by looking at this forum that the majority of people coming to this site would not agree. But then since your in the minority you could always fall back on the excuse that "if people don't like this they don't have to come here" and thats fine. So when all those porno sites start setting up there sites wondering if what they're doing is right they'll just say "if people don't like this they don't have to come here". But the point I'm trying to make is that I find this offencive. I would not like to have my kids (if i have them some day) coming to this site and thinking they should force there beliefs on other people.
<P>Look deep down in your heart, get in touch with God, then tell me if what you think you're doing is right.
