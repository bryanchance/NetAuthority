<P>Why should it, if it didn't like the net, there would knot B no internet.
<P>To some it all up, GET A LIFE! AND STOP BUGGING OTHER PEOPLE WITH YOUR IDEAS.
<P>it's all in the name
<P>> With your demands of regulating and
<BR>> filtering the web and blocking everyhing you
<BR>> dont want to see or dont want others to see
<BR>> you come dangerously close to dark ages in
<BR>> the history of mankind namely the middle
<BR>> ages and the european history of the first
<BR>> half of this century. Why cant you
<BR>> understand that the selfsame rights which
<BR>> you want to destroy, free speech and
<BR>> expression of ones opinion protect the likes
<BR>> such as you ? If the general public were as
<BR>> perverted and oppressive as you claim, they
<BR>> would have prevented you long ago to
<BR>> exercise the right to free speech and free
<BR>> expression of your opinion. Dont you think
<BR>> that you should play by the rules of society
<BR>> and grant the tolerance to others which they
<BR>> grant to you ? Think about that and also if
<BR>> god did not want the internet to happen, why
<BR>> does he not destroy it ?
<P>> regards
<BR>
