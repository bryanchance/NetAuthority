<P>> Hello Fascists
<BR>> This is DiMiTri, proud member at
<BR>> <A HREF="http://www.thetribalunderground.net">www.thetribalunderground.net</A>
<BR>> Today I go to my favorite bbs and begin to
<BR>> read messages from my friends and family(Kid
<BR>> Cid just happens to be my older brother)
<BR>> What do I find when I get there? Someone
<BR>> claiming to be saving our children from the
<BR>> evils of pornography, is violating our
<BR>> sacred little web haven with threating
<BR>> letters. This person didn't register with
<BR>> our site and add to the discussions that
<BR>> they found objectionable. They simply added
<BR>> our site to lists of people they deemed un
<BR>> godly. I have spent my life in the company
<BR>> of who claim to be godly and the first thing
<BR>> I learned from them is if you want your
<BR>> morals to be respected you must give people
<BR>> the right to disagree with them. So on that
<BR>> note I leave you.
<BR>> ...judge not less ye be judged...
<BR>> NAMASTE
<P>Hell yes. I am fully with you.
<P>NAMASTE - literally, ""I honor the place in you where the entire
<BR>universe resides, I honor the place in you where, if you
<BR>are in that place in you, and I am in that place if me,
<BR>there is only one of us."
