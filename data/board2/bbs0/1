<P>My question pertains to the division of your &quot;offensive&quot; categories. Why do you break pornography down into &quot;bestiality&quot;, (note: you might want to check the spelling of that from your Guidelines page) child, interracial, and homosexual? I guess I can understand the seperation between child and adult pornography, but what is the reasoning behind further division? It makes you appear somewhat racist in the interracial division, and homophobic in the homosexual division.
<BR>My second question relates to power/control. What steps have you taken to further empower your organization beyond simple moral defense? Simply put, how do you plan to gain the legal power you admit to lacking within your info page?
<P>Finally, my last question is a theoretical one. If the existence of pornographic material on the internet allows some to relieve their sick and twisted fantasies with damage only to the Jergens bottle, would it be wise to remove this cathardic outlet and send them into the public amongst out childern?
<P>Thank you for time
<BR>I would appreciate it if you used logic and reason within your response, rather than biblical quotes, as I find that easier to follow and less flawed.
<P>
