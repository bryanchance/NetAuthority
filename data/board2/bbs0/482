<P>Frankly, when I stumble upon sites advocating such views as yours, I sincerely hope they are meant as a joke.
<P>First of all; I find it rather amusing that you condemn all so-called "hate messages" - including those discriminating human beings because of their skin color or any other parameter - and then go on to present interracial or gay pornography as equal to bestiality and paedophilia. Doesn't make much sense, does it?
<P>Also, the idea of you deciding what material is suitable for publication on the net is completely hilarious - ever heard of a term called "freedom of speech"? In most countries, the right to publish pornography - including gay and interracial, excluding child pornography and bestiality - is protected by law. This goes for your definition of blasphemy as well. Your threats to press charges against "offenders" are completely empty, and contributes to nothing but making your campaign look silly. Quite a good idea, though, come to think of it.
<P>It ought to be the responsibility of parents to prevent their children from viewing offensive material on the 'net - not "authorities" like you. Those who wish to indulge in the kind of material you are opposed to, has any right to do so, as long as it is not illegal by national law.
<P>True - the world would be just as well off without pornography and hate - but again, it is the responsibility of the netizens to decide what material they wish to download - NOT any self-proclaimed wannabe-authority. Thanks.
