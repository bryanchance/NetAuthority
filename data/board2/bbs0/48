<P>I never thougt that I would say this in any place public or private. What the hell is wrong with this world!!!!!! Groups and people like the one's that apparently support and mantain this site sicken me. The internet was supposed to be a place where anyone could post their views and opinions, without the censors of the mainstream silencing them or forceing them to hide what they feel. I may not practice or condone the actions taken by others but I do believe that everyone has the right to they're own opinion. And I can't stomach the thought of someone forceing me to obey their views or beliefs. If you have a problem with content on the Internet, Newsgroups, or IRC's then for God's sake take the time to learn how to use a computer and make sure your children don't go where you want them to. In other words raise your own children and don't expect anyone to do it for you be it government or group to do it for you.
