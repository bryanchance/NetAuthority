<P>If they are the Net Police, am I allowed to address them as CUNTstables.... :)
<P>> The offending site is yours. Have you seen
<BR>> your forum ? There are lewd \ racial \
<BR>> pornographic comments in it - talk about
<BR>> hypocracy.
<BR>> BTW - I presume you are using some form of
<BR>> site scanner to look for words that match
<BR>> your 'lewd' criteria. You may wanna check
<BR>> cos any site in sCUNThorpe will register, as
<BR>> will many other totally unoffending words
<BR>
