<P>Oh boy, Anarchists.
<BR>Tell me, oh wanderer of the wastes of the human spirit, What happens when your daddy's car gets stolen? Who does he call? The government. Who makes sure people don't go around shooting YOU in particular, seeing as you ask for it? The government. Who gives your place of employment the permission to operate a business, therefore in effect not providing you with employment, in turn not paying you the money you need to live basically. So when you say "Down with Government!," you are basically telling us to kill you. Now, I can tell you are no survivalist. You are just one confused, bitter, angry youth who has watched Full Metal Jacket one too many times. So, you go start your revolution, and I will go buy some more ram with my paycheck =D
