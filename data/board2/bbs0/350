<P>> Ok, so on one hand we have a website that,
<BR>> even when compared to hypocritical,
<BR>> conservative Christian blasphemy such as
<BR>> <A HREF="http://www.godhatesfags.com">www.godhatesfags.com</A> , is completely
<BR>> ludicrous in its arrogance and obviously
<BR>> xenophobic attitude. Based on that
<BR>> observation alone, one might count it as
<BR>> subtle satire. When when you take into
<BR>> account the claim that this small group of
<BR>> radicals are going to supercede the U.S.
<BR>> government and cleanse the internet of legal
<BR>> pornography and "general
<BR>> blasphemy," though, it seems obvious
<BR>> that these people either do not understand
<BR>> the scope of the web today, or that this is
<BR>> some bored-ass liberal's idea of a personal
<BR>> joke. And yes, it does look like that girl
<BR>> in the middle of the choir is giving us the
<BR>> "rock on" sign.
<P>> On the other hand: why? Who would waste
<BR>> their time on something that has no point,
<BR>> and no punchline? It would take somebody
<BR>> with a very odd sense of humor indeed to
<BR>> think that all the work that went into this
<BR>> webpage would be worth a few chuckles and
<BR>> maybe some hatemail (and its doubtful that
<BR>> these people had any idea how many people
<BR>> would find their way into this forum.)
<BR>> Effective satire entails at least SOME form
<BR>> of irony, and all the things ironic and
<BR>> paradoxical about this webpage are universal
<BR>> to most- if not all- Southern Baptist
<BR>> literature. So basically if its real,
<BR>> they're idiots; if its a joke, they're
<BR>> morons; and either way, they've got way too
<BR>> much spare time. Thoughts?
<P>Get a life
<BR>Have a laugh
<BR>Don't take shit so serious
<BR>Yes, we are ALL laughing at YOU
<BR>And of course ONE website CAN make the rules for the whole world - superceding law and national boundaries. Hold your breath till ya die cuz you're wasting oxygen ;~)
<BR>
