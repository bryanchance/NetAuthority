<P>First. YOUR god is not mine. YOU don't speak for me, or 5 billion other people like me. I can tell by the content (Your web pages opening picture has no people any color but white in it! HOW can you presume to say you know what's best for all! By the way, I am white and offended.)that you already have such a set of closed minds that you probably wouldn't know a good and useful website if you were led by the nose there. Do not presume to speak for anyone but you own little pointy heads. You deign to label a website about the IT industry as blasphemous? I find more blasphemy on your site, especially when icomes to speaking the truth. I see none on your site, other than the hue and cry from those you outrage. I won't be the one, but you can bet there will probably a smart guy who will take down this site, and the next one, and the next one.....Simply because people don't want to hear it. People in your church don't want to hear it. People in your families don't want to hear it. Maybe the internet is a cesspool. Then again maybe it's the new primordial soup for our brains to evolve from, to become our own gods. Here and now, You cannot ultimately show anyone that your view is correct. Probably far right wing, by the sound of it, but not right.
