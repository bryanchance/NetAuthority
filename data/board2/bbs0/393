<P>I will probably get listed in the blasphemist, subversive, revolutionary column for this but... I believe the netauthority group here actually violates their own guidelines. While I agree that hate groups need to be controlled, you set up a conflicting message with your guidelines on interacial porn. I, myself, am not a fan of interracial porn, but to each their own.
<BR>Guidelines on blasphemy go way beyond what is acceptable. I believe the Constitution says freedom of religion, i.e. that any religion is acceptable. This is just another example of the Christian Right Neo-Nazi underground trying to subvert the rights of those they find "undesirable". Humor that pokes fun at what Christianity holds dear, is merely a reaction to the overzealous, selfrighteous behavior presented here. So I do encourage everyone who reads this to report <A HREF="http://www.netauthority.org">www.netauthority.org</A> as an offender.
<BR>thank you
