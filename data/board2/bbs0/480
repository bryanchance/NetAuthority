<P>How dare you impose your moral values upon others. There is nothing worse than people who think they have the right to impose their personal morals and beliefs on others.
<P>The internet is not owned by anyone; certainly not by a vigilante group of Americans. You have absolutely no right to contact other sites with such warnings, preaching you rantings and ravings as if you been chosen by a higher power to represent the views of God.
<P>Your intentions for making the internet a safer place for children are amicable, but this is not the way to accomplish it.
<P>Regards,
<BR>Bunty Hoven
