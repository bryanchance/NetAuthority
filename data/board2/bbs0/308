<P>Actually, this site is just a big joke. It fooled me too. Nobody is so stupid that they think they can control the internet. They're just trying to get people all angry, and we're giving them the exact response they wanted. The flames and complaints are what keeps this place alive. I bet they all get a kick out of reading the forums, and seeing how pissed off this place makes people.
<P>It's just a joke, and a damn good one, too.
