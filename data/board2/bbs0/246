<P>Hey guys, I just got an email from Net Authority stating that my website is offensive and all of that shit. Here is my response, but who knows whether it will get back to them:
<P>Your email is harrassment. You have the right to believe whatever you want, but do impose your beliefs on me. Perhaps you should look at the hateful message you included from the anonymous person who reported my website. You have no authority on what is posted on the net. You are a homophobic and racist organization (is homosexual or interracial pornography any different from "normal" pornography?). You are the ones who are in violation. I stand by what I say and believe under the first amendment as stated in the United States Constitution, perhaps you should familiaze yourselves with it. Blasphemy is something that exists only in your mind. Read this article to see where I stand on religion,
<BR><A HREF="http://www.outofstep.net/articles/religion2.html">http://www.outofstep.net/articles/religion2.html</A>, it will no doubt enrage you even more.

<P>Who the hell runs this organization, I say we should all start some sort of protest on this site and do some heavy promoting to destroy it. Check out my website to be offended, haha.
<BR>
