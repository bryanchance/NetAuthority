<P>With your demands of regulating and filtering the web and blocking everyhing you dont want to see or dont want others to see you come dangerously close to dark ages in the history of mankind namely the middle ages and the european history of the first half of this century. Why cant you understand that the selfsame rights which you want to destroy, free speech and expression of ones opinion protect the likes such as you ? If the general public were as perverted and oppressive as you claim, they would have prevented you long ago to exercise the right to free speech and free expression of your opinion. Dont you think that you should play by the rules of society and grant the tolerance to others which they grant to you ? Think about that and also if god did not want the internet to happen, why does he not destroy it ?
<P>regards
