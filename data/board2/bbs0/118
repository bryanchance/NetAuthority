<P>> gee..
<P>> I realize that you guys are trying to
<BR>> improve the i-net for your kids, but really,
<BR>> if you dont want your kids to be seeing the
<BR>> kind of stuff that is out there, dont let
<BR>> them on the net! Its plain, common sense. If
<BR>> you dont want your kids to get burned, you
<BR>> dont hand them matches near a can of
<BR>> gasoline. See? common sense is the best
<BR>> policy for protecting your kids.
<P>> Maybe if you had a database of "decent
<BR>> / kid-safe" sites, it would be more
<BR>> helpful than searching out the myriads of
<BR>> trash thats out there. If you go through
<BR>> life looking for everything that you might
<BR>> consider "bad", you might just
<BR>> miss out on the things that are
<BR>> "good". If you really want to make
<BR>> a difference, dont act like stuck-up
<BR>> zealouts with your emails that try to sound
<BR>> almighty and powerful. You have to realize
<BR>> that no one is going to spend hours looking
<BR>> through a crappy database of sites that
<BR>> theyd never want to go to anyway. The
<BR>> parents would rather go through a database
<BR>> of decent, safe sites that they knew that
<BR>> they COULD go to, without worrying about
<BR>> their kids.
<P>> Common sense is the best policy, but you
<BR>> need a clear mind to have it.
<P>i feel taking a deuce. how about you?
