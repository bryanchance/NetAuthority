<P>That is all this site is. If you read their guidelines; they state that they archive all the stuff that they review and find "objectionable".
<P>It seems to me that this is nothing more than a way to garner large amounts of free porn, particularly with their emphasis on interracial, beastiality, and child porn. And they personally review all these reports? Yup. Just a way to get free porn.
<P>Wish i had thought of it actually; a good way to get all those holier-than-thou assholes to send you really fucked up pornography. Whoever thought this up must be laughing his head off at all those dorks.
