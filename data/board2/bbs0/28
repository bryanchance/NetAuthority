<P>exactly! these people are a bunch of right-wing psycho-christians who are trying to scare and bully people who have opinions. there's a little thing in this country called the FIRST AMENDMENT which guarantees freedom of speech, and which all intelligent americans have a responsibility to uphold. also, the 1st amendment gives us freedom of religion, which means we DON'T have to live by THEIR bible.
