<P>Wow. It's that rarest of breeds, the Internet Redneck. First, you people have NO authority. Secondly, you people have obviously never heard of the First Amendment. Thirdly, you people must buy your uniforms at White Sales. Can you cut the pillowcases into those nice hoods? 'Interracial Pornography'? The sixth question on your questionnaire is such utter nonsense ... accusing people of being evil and blasphemers if they have friends of a different race? So, do I 'Hail the Grand Wizard' to you guys, or will a 'Sieg Heil' suffice? This is, by far, the most moronic, assinine, immature, boneheaded, senseless, reactionary, ass-backward, self-important, judgmental, bigotry-induced pile of horse manure I have EEEEEEEEVER seen. And I live in the Midwest, I've met more than my fair share of rednecks and Neo-Nazis and Klansman-Wannabes. You, sirs and madams (probably just sirs ... if you're racist scum, you're probably sexist slime, too), are the FINEST example of one of the biggest problems facing the world today, that of brainless bigotry. In fact ...
<P>Now that I think about it, NOBODY could be this stupid and still know how to operate a computer. The people who believe these sorts of things are the kind who would use the CD-ROM racks to hold their ice cream cones. This site, and this organization, canNOT be for real. However, on the off chance that this *is* for real, I'll leave you with some advice.
<P>Get with the '90s.
<BR>The 1990s, not the 1790s that you seem to be trapped in.
