<P>I find it rather entertaining and offensive that you plan to save the internet for 'our children.' Did it ever occur to you that adults view pages over the internet as well? I would also like to say that your pushing of your belief onto others is un-called for and unneccesary. NetAuthority will probably never gain law enforcement backing as you hope due to the fact that it is obviously a religious organization and there is a tiny little part in The Constitution of the United States of America that outlines a separation of church and state. Keep your damn beliefs to yourselves. If you don't like whats on the internet, don't use it.
