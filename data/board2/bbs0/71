<P>...Then a war is what you shall have!
<P>Pick on the Demons and Hellspawns of the web suckers. Your asking for a fight you'll never win, let alone, walk away from. I've already traced your IP Address. I know where you are. What will you do when your words and weak little database are met with violence. One shot, one kill. Don't bother looking over your shoulder, I kill from half a mile out. See you in the end of my scope.
<P>The sky is turning red, Return to power draws near.
<BR>Falling to me the skies Crimson Tears,
<BR>Abolish rules made of stone.
<P>Awaiting the hour of reprisal,
<BR>Your time slips away.
