<P>I was raised in a Christian family. Our parents always taught my siblings and I to think for ourselves with the Lord as our guide. We were taught that Jesus loves everyone unconditionally, whether sinner or saved, and that it is up to each individual to judge himself in the eyes of God. &quot;Judge not lest ye be judged&quot;.
<P>It seems to me that those of you in this organization are trying to &quot;play God&quot; on the internet. It is not up to any individual person or group to decide what is right or wrong for any other person or group. That decision can only be made with the Lord's help in one's own heart. Why is it, then, that you see fit to cast judgement upon your fellow man and label him a sinner? Is this not a sin?
<P>The Lord shall punish those who do not do his work. It is not up to us, his children, to regulate God's works on His Earth. We are here to love and serve the Lord. Judging and condemning the Lord's children can only make our salvation more difficult. Please discontinue this blasphemous use of a wonderful gift God has given us.
<P>The Lord walks with each and every one of us every moment of every day. Trust in His Love and Wisdom. Every one of you is in my prayers morning, noon and night. May the Lord guide you to the Light.
<P>God Bless,
<P>David Matthew Thomas
