<P>Well, let's see. I have the following words concerning your noble efforts to police the internet.
<BR>Ahem...
<P>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
<BR>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
<BR>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA (deep breath) HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
<BR>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
<P>Oh yeah, and two more:
<BR>FUCK. and YOU.
<P>When are you thought-nazis going to understand that not everyone shares your beliefs, or your definitions of decency? You don't want your kids surfing for porn? Brainwash them until they are
<BR>so sexually repressed they cringe at the thought of masturbating. I find such tactics infuriating and backwards, but it's your right to do so with your kids if you wish. But me? I like porn. I have a right to see
<BR>it. I like blasphemy. It makes me happy. And what's with categories like "Interracial Pornography"? And "Homosexual Pornography"? Makes you guys sound racist AND homophobic, which you probably are.
<P>A Defiant and Amused Netizen,
<BR>You Suck.
