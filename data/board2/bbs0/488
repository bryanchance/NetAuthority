<P>I attempted to report net authority to themselves today, come to find out info@netauthority, webmaster@netauthority and forum@netauthority are invalid email adresses, according to the "report an offender" app. I guess they cant take constructive criticism ;)
<P>Full text of my submission. (I eventually put my email adress in place of thiers)
<P>This particular website distributes material offensive to myself and in direct violation of the NA-AIUG, specifically the hate literature provision. This group has taken it upon themselves to impose a false ideology on a large, robust community over which they have no real authority. They seek to destroy free thought in our society with a message of intolerance and hate, propagated by the threat of force. This group, through implication, has made it clear that it does not approve of interracial marriages or thinking for onesself. And by making these points clear, they imply that force, either present now or coming in the future, will be used to "correct" said disgressions. The morals of this misled group border on wanton slaying of people everywhere, for no other reason than where one's ancestors originated. While this conjecture may be a bit of a streatch, it is simply the logical end to this group's particular train of thought. I contest that the internet is a harsh place to be. I obtain acess to the internet on a daily basis, often going for days or weeks without coming across a site that could be considered offensive, even be net authorities' standards. Today I came across this site, utterly offensive to me in every way. Freedom is the ultimate good, as described in our fine nation's most respected documents. Freedom is being destroyed and spat upon by fundamentalist groups such as this one. They display an utter lack of consideration for other's freedom, ultimatly believing that they are infallible, gods as it were. For that reason I have checked the general blasphemy option. Any group self-righteous enough to believe they are god's chosen is guilty of this horrid crime. This action inherantly assumes that you know better than god, and are becoming a moral mercenary, a trully dishonorable profession. I give you my e-mail, as I hope to recieve intelligent, well thought out correspondance from you explaining your objectionable position.

<P>Post Script: I honestly hope you can explain yourself, I am wholeheartedly curious.
