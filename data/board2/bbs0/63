<P>Let He who is without sin cast the first stone.
<P>This is what I have said. It is The Word. It shall be so.
<P>Thy claim to see through My eyes. This an afront to my name. How dare anyone say to know the mind of God. I have given thee My Word and My Love and nothing more. Obey My Word, spread My Word, Only I shall enforce The Word.
<P>Attempt to become the hand of God and ye shall feel My Hand. The shepard shall tend only the flock, I shall tend all else. Let not thyn ego become too bold and assume thyn be as Great and Wise as I. Twas the folly of My First Angel, let it not be thyn folly as well. This is My only warning to thee.
<P>Understand that I am everything. I am even that which thy now seek to destroy. Thy can understand only by releasing thyn own motives from My Word. Blessed are those who heed My Word. Blessed are those who teach My Word. Foolish are those who bend My Word to thyn own will. If it exists in the Heavens or on Earth, then it is My Will, and My Will Alone. Thalt shalt not question that which is.
<P>I have moved through this mortal to bring you My Word. Rejoice in the recieving of My Wisdom.
<P>My face moveth apon the shores and apon the deep. I am the Alpha and the Omega. This is The Word of the Lord. It shall be.
