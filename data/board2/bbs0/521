<P>> Further, to investigate the sites that you
<BR>> do, you must obviously partake of the
<BR>> viewing of this blasphemus material, once
<BR>> again violating your own guidelines.
<P>Yeah, but just try submitting this site to the database. For some strange reason, they won't allow it. But they're happy to add other people on the suspicion of others.
<P>I read the site last night, in one of my many hours on the net (studying computer news and general IT stuff, but just try telling the KKK that!), and I had to stifle my raucous laughter at the pathetic attempts to sound legitimate, so that I didn't wake my 21 month old son (born out of wed-lock, to a wife who is of other genetic material. She's short and I'm tall.).
<P>It's nice to see that they advocate the *unlawful* searching of a person's computer.
<P>My name is real, as is my email address. I will be glad to have my name in the KKK's "hate-list", as I hate hate.
