<P>Plaguing on peoples fears of death? Why thats an excellent means of motavation. "PISS US OFF AND BE TORTURED". Dang i really want to join this group now.
<BR>The truth i belive you have the right to belive what you want to belive. I belive in God and Jesus and i belive that what you're trying to do is good. But the way you're doing it IS wrong.
<BR>From now on don't plauge on peoples fears. You may try to convert them all you wish but plague on fears and your as bad as satin in my book.
<P>> Praise the Lord that someone is finally
<BR>> going to CLEAN UP this mess
<BR>> called the Internet!! Too long have
<BR>> pornographers, blasphemers,
<BR>> satanists, and the mass hoardes of the
<BR>> UnGodly who are found wanting in
<BR>> the eyes of Christ had their way with the
<BR>> wonderful technology of the
<BR>> Internet with which the Lord has seen fit to
<BR>> gift us.
<P>> Governments, technologists, and policy
<BR>> makers DO NOT realize the real
<BR>> DANGER that perversion of the Internet
<BR>> presents to our children and to
<BR>> the health and morality of our Great Nation,
<BR>> and if your victory is
<BR>> complete (and I pray daily for your
<BR>> victory), you MUST see that the
<BR>> these offenders of Internet morality are PUT
<BR>> TO DEATH by the sword or by
<BR>> the stone, as prescribed in Our Lord's Holy
<BR>> Word.
<P>> We must remain as True Believers and be
<BR>> zealous in our prosecution of
<BR>> the unrighteous, even unto death. Those who
<BR>> oppose us will burn
<BR>> eternally in HELL where their pain and
<BR>> suffering will be righteous
<BR>> retribution for the suffering and delusion
<BR>> they have imposed upon God's
<BR>> true children here on Earth.
<P>> In Christ,
<BR>> Rev. Lynn C. Doyle
