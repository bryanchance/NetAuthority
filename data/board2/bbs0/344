<P>> ...Then a war is what you shall have!
<P>> Pick on the Demons and Hellspawns of the web
<BR>> suckers. Your asking for a fight you'll
<BR>> never win, let alone, walk away from. I've
<BR>> already traced your IP Address.
<P>With what? Oh, lemme guess - you used to be a 'tracker' in 'the Nam' LOL
<P>>I know where you are.
<P>Please tell me where - I'm lost and can't find my way home. Musta been that last joint.
<P>>What will you do when your words
<BR>> and weak little database are met with
<BR>> violence. One shot, one kill. Don't bother
<BR>> looking over your shoulder, I kill from half
<BR>> a mile out.
<P>I read that book too. Betcha never even seen a real sniper rifle. Maybe I'm assuming too much here, did you really read it or did 'daddy' read it to you?
<P>>See you in the end of my scope.
<P>In your demented dreams
<P>> The sky is turning red, Return to power
<BR>> draws near.
<BR>> Falling to me the skies Crimson Tears,
<BR>> Abolish rules made of stone.
<P>> Awaiting the hour of reprisal,
<BR>> Your time slips away.
<P>Yur a poet and don't know it LOL
<BR>
