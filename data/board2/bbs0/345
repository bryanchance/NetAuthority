<P>Just because I swear, I'm not a Christian? Wow, there must not be very many Christians out there. All the ones I know swear. They're just words. Words to add emphasis, or to express strong feelings. I believe in God, and I believe Jesus was God's human form. But that's just my belief. I consider myself a Christian. If you don't think I am, fine. I don't care. I'm not going to change my mind, just because you think I'm not.
<BR>Dildo breath? Yeah, real mature.
<BR>A lot of people were fooled by this site. You're not some fucking genius just because you weren't. And for all I know, you could be lying about that.
<BR>People like you are really pathetic. You get off on nothing more than bringing other people down and getting into arguements. Post whatever you want about me. This is the last reply you'll get from me, asshole. Fucking flamer.
<P>The Guy
