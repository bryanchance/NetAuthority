<P>Well, hello. I'd first like to say that I'm here simply to point out some of the blinding faults within your policies. And you are truly assholes.
<P>Before I even started this project, I showed this to Jerry Falwell. After he recovered from his heart attack, he said something alone the lines of "people actually live like this? Those fucking assholes."
<P>Without anything further, besides the fact [my comments are in brackets,] here goes:
<P>Net Authority Acceptable Internet Usage Guidelines
<P>These guidelines are broken up into seven distinct sections. Each section goes into detail on the materials considered unacceptable and/or immoral for public distribution or viewing on the Internet. Read these guidelines carefully, for if you violate them you risk being added to the Net Authority databases as an Internet crime offender.
<P>The following material is, without question, unacceptable for public distribution or viewing on the Internet:
<BR>[Yes, as history has shown us that learning only causes problems. God knows how those evil ATHEISTS rid the world of God's precious smallpox.]
<P>Hate Literature
<P>Hate literature entails any media that indicates, direct or implied, one group of persons' superiority over another. This includes, but is not limited to, written material, photographs, rendered images, and multimedia presentations. The groups can be categorized by race, religious beliefs, skin color, association, or
<P>any delimiter that specifies distinct separation of on group of persons from another.
<BR>[Technically, right here brings anthropology pages into the LIST OF THE SINNERS! And evolutionary psychologists, well, I'm beginning to think you'd rather burn their house down and report yourselves than leave them alone.]
<P>If you distrubite, read, aid in the digital transfer of, or are related in any way to hate literature as defined above, you are in violation of the NA-AIUG.
<P>Pornography
<P>Pornographic material is any material that condones, either directly or implied, the human body as an item of sexual desire. This includes but is not limited to, written material, photographs, rendered images, and multimedia presentations. Either utilizing the human body as an item to induce sexual desire, or experiencing sexual desire for the human body as a direct result of using the Internet, puts you in violation of the NA-AIUG.
<BR>[God forbid that humans fuck like it's been hardwired into us. Inducing sexual desire AT ALL is to be punished.]
<P>Child Pornography
<P>Child pornography is a particularly depraved form of pornography (see definition above) that adds the following stipulation: the human body inducing sexual desire is that of a minor (a human of 17 years of age or less). Using the Internet to either distribute or obtain child pornography puts you in violation of the NA-AIUG.
<BR>[Despite that the marrying age used to be 10 or 12 until a few hundred years ago. So either all the peoples of the past committed something that is inherently wrong, or you simply defined child porn as wrong because you didn't like it.]
<P>Bestiality
<P>Bestiality is another relatively depraved and vile form of pornography (see definition above). The stipulation added is as follows: the body inducing sexual desire is that of an animal. This includes the use of the human body and an animal's body at the same time to induce sexual desire. Using the Internet to either distribute or obtain bestiality related material puts you in violation of the NA-AIUG.
<BR>[Well, I don't defend everything I see. But since sexual preference is a genetically programmed instinct, I assume you'll want to start killing these people as fast as you can, to get rid of the gene.]
<P>Homosexual Pornography
<P>Homosexual pornography is a form of pornography (see definition above) in which the use of two or more human bodies of the same gender are used to induce sexual desire. This is a blatant defiance of God's good intentions for his creation, and the involvement with such material over the Internet not only puts you in violation of the NA-AIUG, but also makes you a sinner in the eyes of our Lord.
<BR>[Bah. God's intentions for his creation. You just said that being made horny by porn or even looking at someone on the street cockeyed is a SIN! Look, artificial insemination creates more kids, which is what you say God wants. But since you have to use porn (or a cockeyed enough look) to produce the donated semen in the first place, are all artifically inseminated children abominations?]
<P>Interracial Pornography
<P>Interracial pornography is another form of pornography (see definition above) which adds this stipulation: either there are more than one human bodies of differing racial descent inducing sexual desire, or the human body inducing sexual desire is of differing racial descent of the person in whom the desire is being induced. Distributing, viewing, aiding in the digital transfer of, or being involved in any way with interracial pornography on the Internet puts you in violation of the NA-AIUG.
<BR>[Oh, yes, I forgot, you guys aren't racist. People of different descent are a-okay, so long as they stay away from you and your kids. Again, sex preference in genetic. And you are a group of stupid, stupid fucks. Perhaps if you were to pull Jesus' cock out of your brain and think, you'd disband this whole fucking site and go out for ice cream. But ice cream is the devil's milk. Same thing for Devil's food cake.]
<P>General Blasphemy
<P>Blasphemic content is any material that is seen as sin through the eyes of our Lord.
<BR>[I don't care how long it took you to rip God's eyes out of his head and jam them in your sockets, I heavily doubt that God came down from heaven just to tell you assholes how Jon of goats.com violated HIS MAJESTIC PLANS!!!1!!!!! for humanity.]
<P>It is expected that all Internet users familiarize themselves with The Bible.
<BR>[Because, let's face it, Jews, Hindus, and all the other hell-bound who live in places far, far away from America should get the fuck off YOUR AMERICAN INTERNET!*#&&^$(^%@!(!!!]
<P>Ignorance is no excuse!
<BR>[So how the hell did you get a webpage?]
<P>If you are involved with the distribution of, or obtain in any fashion material that is considered offensive, then you are in violation of the NA-AIUG.
<P>--
<P>General Blasphemy
<P>Registered General Blasphemy Offenders: 734
<P>The general blasphemy list contains information on people who have either read, distributed, or been involved in any way with blasphemic materials on the internet. General blasphemy is material that is considered evil when viewed through the eyes of God.
<BR>[Well, I reported you sick fucks. Never before have I seen such blantant disregard for the Qu'Ran, which says very clearly that it is the one true word of God, so quit corrupting our fucking children and go home.]
<P>--
<P>[This quiz is pure gold.]
<P>Has the suspected offender ever shown a tendency to get angry at people that he or she has never met in person?
<BR>[And I assume you know the entire legislative and executive branches of federal government, or you deeply support the death penalty, the LEGALIZATION OF PORNOGRAPHY, and so on. You fail the quiz, please try again.]
<P>Does the suspected offender spend unusual amounts of time alone with his or her computer while connected to the internet?
<BR>[Because all large files on the internet simply hop out of the server's monitor and take a cab to the intended destination, as opposed to taking the phone lines. But don't let me stop your really, really fruity McCarthyist witchhunt. Fags.]
<P>Has the suspected offender ever shown unnatural affectons towards, or unusual relationships with minors (children aged 17 or younger)?
<BR>[Well, since a very small minority of people are babysitters, that counts as unusual. Same goes for teachers. And pediatricians. So if you want to go to a movie, send kids to school, or have them inoculated so they don't fucking die, YOU ARE EXPOSING THEM TO COMMUNI- I mean sin.]
<P>Has the suspected offender ever shown unnatural affectons towards, or unusual relationships with animals?
<BR>[Again, a very small minority of people are veterinarians. So if your dog scrapes it's ass on the concrete from time to time, well, you know what to do.]
<P>Does the suspected offender sometimes stare at people of his or her same gender in a way which has caused you some suspicion?
<BR>[Because all humans are equipped with a magical "gaydar" that immediately locks on to homosexuals and then the SCUD misslies launch from the cavity where brain used to be stored.]
<P>Does the suspected offender have many friends who are of different racial descent as him or herself?
<BR>[And don't get them started on that Martin something something King, Jr. guy. He was fucked up, man.]
<P>Has the suspected offender ever blasphemed in your presence?
<BR>[I should goddamn hope not. Jesus on a fuckin' bicycle, who would want to vent their Christ-screwing anger in any offensive way?!]
<P>Assuming it turns out that this person is an offender, you may type any comments you wish to anonymously send to the suspected offender in the email that notifies them that they have been added to the database:
<P>[Yes, I'd like to say that if you work for NetAuthority, you should hear your printer starting by now. It is printing out a picture of a baby that's crying right now. It's a picture of you. Right now. You fucking crybabies. The reason there is porn and BLASPHEMY on the internet is the same reason there are porn ads in your newspaper: the internet is not just for kids. The internet is for EVERYONE. When babies create their own file-sharing protocol, I won't post pictures of hot sex there. No one asked you to baby-proof the Net, and you using kids as a human shield for your impotent arguments makes me fucking sick. During the brief moments when Jesus wasn't moaning due to the large amount of child animal cock firmly in his ass, he told you to FOLLOW THE LAWS OF YOUR NATION. Let's put this site to legal tests.
<P>Offense 1: Abridging the right of free speech.
<BR>Offense 2: Harassment to website owners.
<BR>Offense 3: Hate crimes against Non Christians, gays, and non fundamentalists.
<BR>Offense 4: Slander and Libel, for implying that the views of the children pictured on the main page represent yours. At least one is bound to enjoy sex at some point.
<BR>Offense 5: Violation of 4th Amendment Equal Protection, by disallowing all hate speech not flowing from your mouth, anmd highly deferential treatment to Christians.
<BR>Offense 6: Impersonation of a police officer.
<P>Add this all up, and if this isn't worth the death penalty, then I'd be glad to kill you anyways.
<P>I'm sure if someone hadn't misplaced God's gun, he'd kill you all for twisting his word to the breaking point. I'm a fucking Atheist and I hope you go to hell.]
<BR>
