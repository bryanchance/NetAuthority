<P>Hey, who ordered the large shipment of sub-machine guns?
<P>Take your God, your moderated everything and go back to Eden.
<P>Please don't attempt to be the "mommy" of the internet, because you'll only find that the people taking you down are your very own "children."
<P>Just my two cents.
<P>Thanks for the waste of bandwidth that is your site.
<P>*E-mails the US Congress requesting the deletion of your site for its "We've got an imaginary guy on our side so we're better than you" mentality. Religiousism, perhaps?*
<P>-Terribly
