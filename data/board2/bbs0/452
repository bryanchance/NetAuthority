<P>Dear Net authority:
<P>I am a fine christian in touch with the word of God. As I read more into your good site (Please include scripture!) I am questioning the proof of your website.
<P>If you may, can you provide me with some form of proof, such as Church, Pictures, etc. So I (and these non-believers) that this web site is not of joking nature and is to be seen as a "Stormfront(.org)" for christians everywhere. ;)
<P>Thank you for your time.
<BR>
