<P>I found this site to be very hypocritical...you say hate literature is any content that indicates either directly or implied the superiority of one group over another, whether it be based on race, culture, RELIGION, and so forth...&quot;It is expected that all internet users familiarize themselves with the Bible. Ignorance is no excuse!&quot; What about people who's religious beliefs don't follow the bible? It sounds to me like proclaiming Christianity superior to all other religions, thus, as your guidelines would have us to belive, making it hate literature. I have no choice but to report this site as an internet offender for hate literature. Good Day ;)
