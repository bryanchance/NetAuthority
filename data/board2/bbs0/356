<P>> Why is there a saparate database for
<BR>> interractial pornography? I can't think of
<BR>> any reason other than bigotry. Did I miss
<BR>> something?
<P>I'd like to report <A HREF="http://www.netauthority.org">www.netauthority.org</A> to netauthority for being racist biggots in distinguishing between "regular" pornography and "interracial" pornography. We don't want your kind around here. I hope Netauthority takes appropriate steps to banish <A HREF="http://www.netauthority.org">www.netauthority.org</A> from the web.
<BR>
