<P>Lets start with the "info" page:
<P>"The Net Authority is a group of individuals who have taken it upon themselves to govern the Internet."
<P>Translation: We have no authority.
<P>"We have waited patiently and in vain for the World's governments to put their resources together and develop a standard set of guildelines for what material should be permitted on the Internet, and what should not."
<P>Translation: We were hoping for the imposible, and are 100% aginst Freedom of Speech.
<P>"We have prayed without answer...."
<P>Translation: There is no God.
<P>"The time for waiting has ended. Clearly we, the people, must take matters into our own hands."
<P>Translation: Time to burn all the Niggers and Jews!!
<P>"Net Authority writes those guidelines. Net Authority is that agency."
<P>Translation: We will tell you what to think, read, say, and do. We control the horizontal and the vertical. We are the Supreme High and Mighty Master Control Program.
<P>"Net Authority's primary function is to devise and maintain a set of standards for Internet material. These standards clearly lay out what is and is not acceptable material for public distribution over the Internet. The purpose of the standards is to eventually replace today's filth and smut ridden Internet with the cleaner, healthier, and overall more effective Internet of tomorrow."
<P>Translation: Pipe Dream.
<P>"The Net Authority Acceptable Internet Usage Guidelines (NA-AIUG) are based solely on the desirable morals of civilized society."
<P>Translation: We made some rules based on what WE think is right, without consulting anybody else, because of course, we're smarter and more civilized than everyone else.
<P>"Their basic effect is to simply organize and prioritize all that is blasphemous in the eyes of God."
<P>Translation: We know what God wants (even though he is just a figment of our collective imagination).
<P>"It is only natural for one of the tools of His creation to be adapted and molded into a form that He finds acceptable. Net Authority merely acts as a catalyst for that process."
<P>Translation: Because We don't like it, God must surely not like it either. We're gonna persicute and burn at the stake anyone attempt to stand in the way of our Holy Crusade aginst the tirany of evil men.
<P>"Any set of guidelines is useless without some way to enforce the standards that they detail. Net Authority recognizes this fact and has thus put together a team of policy enforcers."
<P>Translation: To keep this all from being a bunch of hot air, we've assembled an Elite Fighting Force of Tank Paratroopers to burn a swastika into your forehead.
<P>"Primarily through use of the written word, the Net Authority Police enforce and punish those who disobey the standards set forth in the Net Authority Acceptable Internet Usage Guidelines."
<P>Translation: We're gonna send YOU a very nasty letter.
<P>"While we may not yet have any legal power to back our enforcement of the NA-AIUG, our cause is justified in the eyes of God, which gives us all the authority we desire."
<P>Translation: Once again, we have no authority but, OUR GOD (the one that doesn't exist) said it's OK to burn you at the stake.
<P>"On occasion, Net Authority teams up with local law enforcement agencies in order to physically eliminate material in breach of the NA-AIUG."
<P>Translation: We're gonna tell on yooooouuu!
<P>"After these events, Net Authority retains the offending materials and their media, while the perpetrator remains in the custody of said local law enforcement agency."
<P>Translation: We've got some serious monkey spanking to do.
<P>"The media containing the offending materials is then quickly disposed of by means that render the media, and thus all content, unusable."
<P>Translation: We've got a bridge in New York to sell to you sucker.
<P>"Net Authority is also the leading source of Internet offender tracking. We maintain several large databases of the names and personal information of individuals who have breached the NA-AIUG."
<P>Translation: We're gonna write YOUR name down. We'll be watching YOU!"
<P>"These databases are continually updated and maintained in preparation for when Net Authority gains the legal means to prosecute and punish these individuals."
<P>Translation: Soon our Nazi Storm Troopeers will replace existing police departments because there are just too many "Rodney Kings" out there who need to get their asses beat down on the side of the road. We're gonna come to your house and give you a spanking!
<P>"Our databases are the largest and most accurate of their kind in existence, as they rely on the Internet population as a whole to keep them up to date."
<P>Tranlation: The Witch Hunt Method, we learned it by reading The Crucible. Worked GREAT in that book, will work great for us.
<P>"In these times of widespread chaos and blatant defiance of our Lord, we must work together."
<P>Translation: We're all going to hell in a hand basket, but us elite bastards get to drive.
<P>"With our help and yours, the Internet can become a much safer, more enjoyable, and friendly environment to work in."
<P>Translation: Blah-blah-blah....and a whole bunch of other crap that will never happen.
<P>Wow, they sound like a great couple of guys. We need them to lead us to the homeland to forge our master race.
<P>Here is a pic of the next Hitler Youth:
<BR>(As Judge Carlos would say: Der!+Der!=DER-DER!!)
