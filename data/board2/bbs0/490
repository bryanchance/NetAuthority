<P>I have read over a copy of an e-mail you sent to a friend of mine regarding his website, and I must say I am gravely disappointed. I understand a desire to protect children from 'dangerous' people and ideas, but somewhere along the way you have overstepped your rights.
<P>Taken directly from the letter you sent him...
<BR>"It is imperative that you fully
<BR>understand the guidelines if you wish to avoid further prosecution."
<P>Where do you have the authroity to prosecute anyone? Your letter and statement imply some kind of legal retribution against my friend for his ideas. Last time I checked, the Constitution of the United States protected his right to freedom of expression, and freedom of religion. Do you seek now to bring legal charges against him for his site?
<P>No, I doubt you even could.
<P>Here is what you will do...
<P>1. You will send an apology letter to EVERYONE who has received such a notification from you. This apology will cover the fact that you do not in fact have the authroity to prosecute ANYONE.
<P>2. You will cease and desist any further notification of any private website owner of such addition to your databases. You have the right to tell people what you want, but you do not have the right to tell someone they cannot have their particular religious beliefs.
<P>3. You will identify the name of your organization leaders to the public, so that a proper appeals process can take place based on your 'decision' to block their website.
<P>If these items are not carried out with the next 7 days, I do fully intend to bring your organization out into the full light of day, exposing your racist, bigoted, hateful ideals to the public eye.
<P>I have given you my real name and my real e-mail address. I have no fear of your organization, nor should I have. Your behavior is unacceptable in this enlightened age, and I would hope that you could comport yourselves with a little more restraint in the future.
<P>- Mark Cogan
<BR>
