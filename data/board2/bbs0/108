<P>Yes, NetAuthority, thank you very much for providing such a useful service. It's about time someone did something. I've not seen as much unholiness in my entire life as I have since I've been online these past few months.
<P>*Remember, netauthority.org. these are the sinners that are objecting to such a useful service. God rewards those who are faithful in times of temptation.
