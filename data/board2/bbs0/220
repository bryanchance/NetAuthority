<P>> exactly! these people are a bunch of
<BR>> right-wing psycho-christians who are trying
<BR>> to scare and bully people who have opinions.
<BR>> there's a little thing in this country
<BR>> called the FIRST AMENDMENT which guarantees
<BR>> freedom of speech, and which all intelligent
<BR>> americans have a responsibility to uphold.
<BR>> also, the 1st amendment gives us freedom of
<BR>> religion, which means we DON'T have to live
<BR>> by THEIR bible.
<P>It's all right dude!...take a chill pill and be comforted in the fact that THEY don't LIVE by THEIR BIBLE either!! If they were, these characters would realize just what a bunch of hypocrites they really are and would turn and crawl back under the rocks that they came from...
<BR>
