<P>Matthew 7:1-6 KJV
<BR>"Judge not, that you be not judged.
<BR>For with what judgement you judge, you will be judged; and with the same measure you use, it will be measured back to you.
<BR>And why do you look at the speck in your brothers eye, but do not consider THE PLANK IN YOUR OWN EYE?
<BR>Hypocrite! First remove the plank from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck out of your brother's eye.
<BR>Do not give what is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces."
<P>Those are the words of Jesus. Now for mine:
<BR>Whomever authored this sight spent a great deal of time with the computer. Probably alone, probably online. Are they also evil? Many of the messages on this board have lewd content. Why have you not taken steps to censor that language?
<P>I believe that all the time & money you spent developing this websight was wasted. It would have gone to much better use if instead of condemming them you would go to the prisons and council these sexual predators. You will find that many of them were victims of criminal sexual abuse themselves, and they need help.
<P>Remember The road to HELL is paved with good intentions
<P>
