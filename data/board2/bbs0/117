<P>gee..
<P>I realize that you guys are trying to improve the i-net for your kids, but really, if you dont want your kids to be seeing the kind of stuff that is out there, dont let them on the net! Its plain, common sense. If you dont want your kids to get burned, you dont hand them matches near a can of gasoline. See? common sense is the best policy for protecting your kids.
<P>Maybe if you had a database of "decent / kid-safe" sites, it would be more helpful than searching out the myriads of trash thats out there. If you go through life looking for everything that you might consider "bad", you might just miss out on the things that are "good". If you really want to make a difference, dont act like stuck-up zealouts with your emails that try to sound almighty and powerful. You have to realize that no one is going to spend hours looking through a crappy database of sites that theyd never want to go to anyway. The parents would rather go through a database of decent, safe sites that they knew that they COULD go to, without worrying about their kids.
<P>Common sense is the best policy, but you need a clear mind to have it.
