<P>I agree: I used to be a Koresh fearing Luddite but after the Free Republic got a hold of me, I can't stop thinking about Bill Clinton's cock! Even after the Extreme Court appointed a new resident, the Free Republic has ramped up the tirade against Bill, Hillary, Chelsea and Willard! Make them stop! They are promoting HATE SPEECH and PORNOGRAPHIC IMAGES!

<P>> I'd like to report
<BR>> <A HREF="http://www.freerepublic.com">http://www.freerepublic.com</A> for being the
<BR>> hate site that whips me into a frenzy!
<BR>> Thanks to that site, I now feel it is
<BR>> essential to wipe out gays, non-whites, and
<BR>> anybody who isn't a Christian. I find myself
<BR>> daydreaming about taking over the world, and
<BR>> knitting tin-foil hats, instead of going to
<BR>> work. Please make these people stop putting
<BR>> voices in my head, and causing me to vote
<BR>> Republican. Thank you.
<BR>
