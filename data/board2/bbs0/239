<P>I'm going to drop a little knowledge for you.
<BR>Since the time that Kid Cid has had a computer I've known there are thing on that computer that I don't want to see. I have had that sense to stay away from it. You fascist net authority bastards have some how found a little window in to his computer and don't like what you find. Know what you should do ? never look through that window again.
<BR>The next point I need to make is, if you seriously think you are going to win this little flame war you are sadly mistaking. I suspect the "objectionable" material you found on our site was from the last little battle Kid Cid waged.(please e-mail me with the list of things that started this little fiasco)
<BR>I leave you with one quote:
<BR>...set the coffin where ya like, cause if ya test the champion. your gonna die tonight...
