<P>Your whole damn site offends me, religion is the main cause of the large majority of brutality, violence and suffering in this world.
<P>Religion encourages intolerance and hatred of anything different from your set rules of 'what is right'.
<P>There are hundreds of religions in this world and they all say the same damn thing... 'ours is the one true god', ours is the only true faith' and this always leads to violence.
<P>Religion is a dying thing, comparable to racism which it does alot to encourage. Ancient superstition thieved and abused by those in power to force people to conform to lives of drudgery where the only hope is everlasting life once your dead .... this makes no sence what so ever. Almost all major christian events just happen to fall on about the same day as ancient pagan days of importance.
<P>You people disgust me, who are you to tell me what is right and wrong? I live my life by my own morals and standards not by the commands of some self appointed authority.
<P>Pray for my soul, do whatever it is that makes your obviously pityful lives fullfilled, but dont ever think to try and force your opinions on me.
<P>
