<P>What your doing is getting people to be frightened by your "burn in hell" antics and tricking people to belive what you belive by fear.
<BR>"DO WHAT I SAY OR YOU WILL BE TORTURED FOR ALL OF ETERNITY". What a lovely christian.
<P>> Thank you for taking a stand against all
<BR>> that
<BR>> is ungodly and sinful. I know many people
<BR>> will
<BR>> burn in hell for the things have done,
<BR>> particularly the indecent obscene sex they
<BR>> are having all the time.
<P>> Now, if you could only make sure that
<BR>> people are punished by the sword of
<BR>> righteousness, they would not dare mock the
<BR>> Lord anymore!
<BR>
