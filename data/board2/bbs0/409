<P>> you should be thainking this fine
<BR>> organization for the service they are
<BR>> providing you.
<BR>Which service would that be? The mild amusement I get from the sheer bulk of stupidity that these guys have when it comes to their nazi/taliban thinking?
<P>The fact that the taliban and nazis, just like these guys, thought they were doing the "RIGHT" thing?
<P>The arrogance of the mind that believes that it knows what is right and what is wrong and can dictate it to the rest of the world?
<P>Even the name of the web site is baselessly arrogant. Many net-cops have come and gone and have had no real impact on the internet. These small minded simpletons are no different.
