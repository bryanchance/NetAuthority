<P>Stop posting flames. Fill out the 'suspect' questionairre for yourself.
<BR>You too can get an e-mail that says:
<BR>"Dear Name,
<P>It has recently been brought to our attention that you are, or have been, in violation of the Net Authority Acceptable Internet Usage Guidelines. It has been reported that you distribute and/or view offensive materials over the Internet.
<P>Net Authority has investigated these claims and verified that they are true.
<P>As a result, your personal information has been added to one or more Net Authority Internet offender databases. Your information will be stored in the databases until enough evidence has been gathered against you to warrant further actions. To help avoid such a situation, it is strongly recommended that you cease your immoral actions on the Internet at once.
<P>You have been added to the following databases:
<BR>- Hate Literature Offenders
<BR>- Pornography Offenders
<BR>- Homosexual Pornography Offenders
<BR>- Interracial Pornography Offenders
<P>If you would like more information about Net Authority or the Net Authority Acceptable Internet Usage Guidelines, you may read the details at <A HREF="http://www.netauthority.org/">http://www.netauthority.org/</A>. It is imperative that you fully understand the guidelines if you wish to avoid further prosecution.
<P>While the individual who reported your actions to us will remain anonymous, he or she wished to pass these words on to you:
<P>"I knew it all along."
<P>May God be with you as you struggle to overcome these evil impulses. You will be in our prayers at night.
<P>God speed,

<P>I filled it out for myself and said yes to a few of the questions just to see what would happen. That's what happened. I've never written a word of hate literature, and no investigating has ever been done one me except for the suspect questionairre. Any site that makes a claim to legitimacy would at least check that much.
<P>It's a joke, folks. So quit with the flamingness and chill outness. :)
