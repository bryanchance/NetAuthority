<P>you right-wing psychopaths need to stop taking the law into your own hands! let the government deal with the things that actually are illegal (i.e. child porn and duck porn) and get a life. god doesn't want you to waste your time persecuting people who happen to have opinions other than your own. once upon a time, there was another group of people who controlled what people could say and do...they were called NAZIS! and you can't base your whole life on a book that was written two thousand years ago or more. really, get a life!
