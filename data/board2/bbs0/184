<P>Folks,
<P>Do you let your young children go down town by themselves? What on earth makes you think that the internet is any different?
<P>You are going to expend a lot of energy in a fruitless quest. I suggest that a better course of action is setting up a child friendly network or at least a collection of URLs suitable for children.
<P>Cheers,
<P>--
<BR>AndrewV
