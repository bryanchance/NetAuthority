<P>Firstly, might I point out that you blaspheme against the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior by placing yourself in a position to judge others. Lest you find yourself judged by the Lord for your pride, I beg you to repent now for your hubris.
<P>Further, your material violates your own hate literature guidelines in that you place yourselves above others as you must if you think that you can thusly judge them. To quote your own guidelines.
<P>"Hate Literature
<BR>Hate literature entails any media that indicates, direct or implied, one group of persons' superiority over another...If you distrubite, read, aid in the digital transfer of, or are related in any way to hate literature as defined above, you are in violation of the NA-AIUG."
<P>Further, to investigate the sites that you do, you must obviously partake of the viewing of this blasphemus material, once again violating your own guidelines.
