<P>: I found this site to be very hypocritical...you
<BR>: say hate literature is any content that
<BR>: indicates either directly or implied the
<BR>: superiority of one group over another,
<BR>: whether it be based on race, culture,
<BR>: RELIGION, and so forth...&quot;It is
<BR>: expected that all internet users familiarize
<BR>: themselves with the Bible. Ignorance is no
<BR>: excuse!&quot; What about people who's
<BR>: religious beliefs don't follow the bible? It
<BR>: sounds to me like proclaiming Christianity
<BR>: superior to all other religions, thus, as
<BR>: your guidelines would have us to belive,
<BR>: making it hate literature. I have no choice
<BR>: but to report this site as an internet
<BR>: offender for hate literature. Good Day ;)
<P>hehe, just what i was about to do, finally someone that can understand the offense that this site causes
<BR>
