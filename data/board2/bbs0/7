<P>If you wish for your children to not see what you consider offensive material, than regulate their usage. Not only would it be bad parenting to allow your child onto the internet WITHOUT supervision, but it would prove that you did an incredibally rotten job of raising them if they are actually SEEKING the sites you lable as offensive. The internet is a form of press. I have a freedom; the freedom of press. If you try to deny my access to publishing the content I choose, and making it viewable to my audience, you are defining my freedom. And freedom defined is freedom denied. Perhaps, instead of sticking little Johnny in front of the television, or TAKING HIM TO CHURCH (Where, by the way, he'll learn nothing about the real world. www.cthulhu.org might be something you want to look into) you should have been spending some quality time with him. Don't attack us, the intelligent, the thought provokers, the freedom fighters, for your shitty job. Are you going to talk about porno pop up ads? I've never encountered a porn pop up unless I've been browsing for it. You gonna talk about Stile Project? I never found Stile Project until I went looking for it. How did I hear about it? A friend. &quot;Oh, well there you go! It's the friends!&quot; Watch who your children are friends with. I don't know why the subject of this post was placed in question form, it's obvious that YOU'RE ALL IDIOTS. Have fun in heaven, sitting on your asses, while I'm in hell fornicating and snorting coke.
