<P>its probabaly a hoax the same way <A HREF="http://www.manbeef.com">www.manbeef.com</A> is a hoax. its a very nicely done site and someone put a lot of work into it, however it is a hoax to sell their apparel. matter of fact, <A HREF="http://www.manbeef.com">www.manbeef.com</A> is a LOT better than this one.
<P>> If it is a hoax they went out of their way
<BR>> to pull it off, I found out about it after
<BR>> they harassed several other sites
<BR>> (www.paul-rocks.org and
<BR>> <A HREF="http://www.angelfire.com/goth/retards/index.html">www.angelfire.com/goth/retards/index.html</A>
<BR>> for example). I hope this site is a hoax,
<BR>> because these people seem like total
<BR>> fanatics.
