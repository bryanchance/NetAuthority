<P> Yeah so I'm reading a post a friend put up. I am shocked to see this religous propaganda writing on what they thing is best...for the internet HA. You all have no control over what goes on or what people put on the internet. It really makes me laugh when you follow these strict guidlines of yours when I know more than half of the men in your little group are looking these sites lat at night when the miss's is asleep... I belive in myself. I belive that I don't have to ask for forgivness to anyone. The Problem with you all is this , you think it's okay to sin... and after asking for forgivness to Blah Blah no name whatever (god) you think it's okay. Well it's not. don't just shrug that off I mean damn your worst enemys are getting away with rape and murder and what not and they belive in the same god as you HAHAHA... I would feel awuful if some rapist came up to me and told me that i had something in common with me.
<P>Oh well you post your trash as much as you want. And ummmm you condol this launguage here in your little group I hope your brainwashed kids don't speak with a tounge like this:
<BR>It is imperative that you fully understand the
<BR>guidelines if you wish to avoid further prosecution.
<BR>While the individual who reported your actions to us will remain anonymous, he
<BR>or she wished to pass these words on to you:
<P>"i hope you burn in hell you whore"
<P>This is okay by your guidelines? Here is a line from your guidlines :
<P>Hate literature entails any media that indicates, direct or implied, one group of persons' superiority over another. This includes, but is not limited to, written material I don't know how you all could let this slip by you for someone to say such hateful things and then for you to pass them on to someone else? Maybe you should rewrite your guidlines and or Red them agian. Here is what you say afterwards. Maybe it should be said to that annomous person.
<P>May God be with you as you struggle to overcome these evil impulses.
<P>God speed
<P>I don't know seems to me like your promoting hate. Well you all have a wonderful closed of to the world life and enjoy it while you can you only get one shoot at this... Please do not send me hate mail.
<P>Thank you
<P>Red
<BR>
