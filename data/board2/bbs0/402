<P>Petty tyrants like you are more scary than any of the so-called offensive sites you want to regulate. The essence of the Internet is the free exchange of ideas--not censorship by self-important elitists like yourselves. Finally, give it up with that "we're doing it for the children" garbage. This is the same excuse all you would-be despots have been using for years. The Internet should never have to reduce itself to the level of Dr. Seuss lest some three year old surfer be offended.
