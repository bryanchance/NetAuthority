<P>Only in America could this site have been concieved and created. A country founded by Pompus Brits and Religious Fanatics and Canadians forced to move south by the british. (bet you didn't know French speaking "Cajuns" are decentants of Canadian "Acadians") What gives you the right? Nothing at all. You think you are rightous in the eyes of God. I'm willing the bet my imortal soul that it's people like you that God banishes to Hell. How can you even be sure what the bible says it true. A book written 2000 years ago, by several different people translated dozens of times. For all you fuckin know one of the 10 commandments "Thou shalt not force your beleifs on others." I love Christians, they tend, not all, to beleive that they have all the answers and anyone not with them is going straight to hell. The people who made this site are a tiny minority who think they have the right to govern everyone, even thoughs who do not share their beliefs.By the way, the interracial pornography guideline makes me think you are some form of neo-nazi, skin-head group hiding behind a bogus site. I'll bet the founder of this site is so sexualy deprived, represessed and perverted that they are shamed into making this site so they can feel good about themselves.
<BR>And so, I leave you with this...Fuck You
<P>Lars
