<P>If you pertain yourselves to be a serious organisation, how can you possibly stand by your comments on &quot;Do people ever mistakenly get added to the database?&quot;. Read it yourselves... you claim in a round about fashon that noone ever does. You have no means for a falsely accused person to defend themselves. This is both unethical and immoral on your part.
<P>In the same comments on the FAQ page, you basically claim that the only reason anyone would say someone was falsely added was because they are physically threatened to say so. In theory I could add the ministers of all my local churches as viewers of illegal pornography. Lets say they were acting differently, and on the Internet a lot. Who knows they could really be simply researching on the net for their sermons, and may seem different because they are busy. But hey the telltale signs are there, they must be looking at illegal pornography! Your site leaves no ability for them to get themselves removed, thus slandering and ruining the reputation of a worthwile member of society. I wouldnt do such a thing for a joke, but many could or would.
<P>You have appointed yourselves to be judge, jury and executioner, without requiring a shread of evidence other than someones word that a person has been aloof and on the Internet a lot. They are then slandered as being involved in &quot;illegal pornography&quot;. Even the bible in the Old Testiment required 2 witnesses to the crime (not one person who is suspicious or claims to be of someone).
<P>Jesus was accused of a crime he did not commit, but did not open his mouth to defend himself, in order than he could fulfill the scriptures and God's will. You are are accusing people of things they in some cases they may not be guilty of, yet unlike Jesus who CHOSE not to open his mouth, you dont even give them the oportunity to defend themselves, instead you accuse them further of physical violence.
<P>For actual sites, it is easy to see who is doing what, and what is on different sites. For PEOPLE, it is not so easy. The only way to do so would be to hack into computers and look at log files etc. If you DO this sort of thing, then be warned these practices carry heafty jail terms.
<P>Your site and those who run it are a disgrace. I fully suspect that you will delete this message off the webboard, as you will not be able to take sound and well argued critisism, but I suggest you think twice.
<P>Overall, sites blocking pornography are good, but you go about it the wrong way. I await your reply
