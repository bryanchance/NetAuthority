<P>> Actually, this site is just a big joke. It
<BR>> fooled me too. Nobody is so stupid that they
<BR>> think they can control the internet. They're
<BR>> just trying to get people all angry, and
<BR>> we're giving them the exact response they
<BR>> wanted. The flames and complaints are what
<BR>> keeps this place alive. I bet they all get a
<BR>> kick out of reading the forums, and seeing
<BR>> how pissed off this place makes people.
<P>> It's just a joke, and a damn good one, too.
<P>Actually if it is intended as satire, its not a very good one. Satire requires irony, and there's no more irony here than in most conservative Christian websites. I just can't imagine anyone bored enough to create a joke as pointless and obscure as this.
<P>Either these people are dead serious or they just haven't finished making their point yet.
<BR>
