<P>Actually I would say a better argument for the Hate Literature accusation for this site would be the deparate listings of pornography and interracial pornography. That implies that other races are inferior. But then again, I think it doesn't really matter because I think the site is just a well-made practical joke.

<BR>> Doesn't this very website fall under your
<BR>> definition of "Hate Literature",
<BR>> given that you
<BR>> imply that 'porography' viewers are somehow
<BR>> 'inferior'
<BR>> and should be regulated?
