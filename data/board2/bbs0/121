<P>oh i did read the whole thing but i was a bit distracted by my (oh the admins will love this) Interracial girlfriend was on the phone so some of what i read didn't sink in.. whether it was because of comments like "Unibomber was the last great one" or perhaps the chest thumping "you think you can take me?". I apollogize for not giving your post my full attention before attempting to point out your faulty and immature ranting...
<P>oh and Don't be so quick to accuse someone of having ADD when the majority of your post are based on if not straight qotes from movies and songs... the only things that people today seem to have the attention span for.. granted the movies you've qouted aren't bright and colorfull enought to entertain today's children you still seem (based on this thread) to be more like a child than a maturing adult. My point of all of this thread has been to choose your battles more carefully.. This site IS NOT worth it as i see you've posted below.. And advocating violence on a site like this only makes their efforts more viable in THEIR minds.. The last thing we need is to make a martyr out of this site..However i would like to see a boycott of the internet like the Southern Baptists tried to boycott Disney.. i could use the extra bandwidth. these people spread their misguided beliefs like a nickle whore spreads VD.. .. I'm one for totaly dominating a Message forum but i atleast try to guage my attitude to the best form of attack..
<P>my final post to THIS thread..
<P>oh and just show no totaly hard feelings here's a quote..
<P>"Ira, You are the man"
