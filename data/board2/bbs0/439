<P>2nd paragraph after 'The Guidelines':
<BR>"The Net Authority Acceptable Internet Usage Guidelines (NA-AIUG) are based solely on the desirable morals of civilized society. Their basic effect is to simply organize and prioritize all that is blasphemous in the eyes of God. It is only natural for one of the tools of His creation to be adapted and molded into a form that He finds acceptable. Net Authority merely acts as a catalyst for that process." (Emphasis mine)
<P>So, what this implies is that, the internet is a creation of God, and not of DARPA, the Department of Defense, the IETF, or Al Gore?
