<P>Think i'll add 2 quotes from your own site here, read them carefully and see if you spot the contradiction.
<P>"Hate literature entails any media that indicates, direct or implied, one group of persons' superiority over another. "
<P>"Homosexual pornography is a form of pornography in which the use of two or more human bodies of the same gender are used to induce sexual desire. This is a blatant defiance of God's good intentions for his creation, and the involvement with such material over the Internet not only puts you in violation of the NA-AIUG, but also makes you a sinner in the eyes of our Lord."
