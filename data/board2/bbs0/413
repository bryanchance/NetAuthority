<P>Netauthority is hah, hah, only serious! I'm not sure if this'll make sense for computer antisavy people, but if you do a whois on netauthority.org you'll notice that in fact its nameserver is mikeycomics.com. If you go to mikeycomics.com you'll see some raunchy condom related humor. Also, if you do an nslookup on netauthority.org & on mikeycomics.com you'll notice that in fact they're the same ip address.
<P>For those of you who don't know computers that means that they're the same computer. It's somebody's practical joke. I think it's a pretty good one at that! I wonder if there's any chance they'd open up the database as a nice little pr0n collection. Hahahaha!! Just joking. Now if you want to see a site that should be added to their little database, well mine should qualify on many counts (just added some evil pictures of the top halves of females I took at Woodstock 99. Oh, the horror!)
