<P>I complete;y disagree with much of what you do here. I admit that there are many bad aspects of pornography but you don't respect others personal rights. You think that your rights come first. There is no porn on his site, only a joking poll about penis length. He didn't make anyone vote in it or visit his site, so what's wrong if he uts it up.
<P>I personally disagree with organized religion but I don't put up sites talking about how I hate it and people should not go to these sites. If you want to go to the site it's your own choice, but he doesn't fit any part of it besides for his poll.
<P>Also I think that people have the choice to their own religion. You can call me a heathen all you want, but I believe in god. I might not read the bible or attend church but that's my choice and if you disagree with me fine. My point is that to you I'm not a good person because of my lack of "faith". I get good grades, don't drink or do drugs, and follow the morals of the bible.
<P>Also you post hate sites. That's good. Racism is bad and shouldn't be tolerated, but as you say this, you mention the bible. This is important because in all my expirence with this, you don't include homosexuals. I ask, "how can you preach love and aceptance as you banish a group people because of something that they can't control?". You might think that they choose to be homosexual, but why would you chose a life of prejudice and hate aganist you?
<P>Overall I think that putting my friends site in your database was wrong. You jugde others yourself, but probally get offended when I judge you here. Please visit his site. The URL is <A HREF="http://morty.50megs.com">http://morty.50megs.com</A> and it also appears in the optional URL place. Thank you for reading my opinions, as I have red this site's. God be with ye.
