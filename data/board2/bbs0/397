<P>I just stumbled upon your little site. I began reading your guidelines and first up hate literature - and for a second I thought - okay this site might be a good thing - but then I read on to find you guys are full of hate - I can feel it through your shitty anti-gay, anti-black (any colour other then white), anti-(any ideas countering christianity). I've come to the conclusion that freedom of speech is good but people are fucking sheep and I was hoping you guys would be on the look out for child pornography and blatant hate crimes. I wouldn't have a problem that focused on such obvious evils. But for you guys to say your worried about children and fill then minds with your fears - you guys bug me as much as the child pornographers - well okay not as much but fuck this made me pissed for some reason ???????
