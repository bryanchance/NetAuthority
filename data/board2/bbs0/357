<P>> Get a life
<BR>> Have a laugh
<BR>> Don't take shit so serious
<BR>> Yes, we are ALL laughing at YOU
<BR>> And of course ONE website CAN make the rules
<BR>> for the whole world - superceding law and
<BR>> national boundaries. Hold your breath till
<BR>> ya die cuz you're wasting oxygen ;~)
<P>A laughable and immature (and not to mention ineffective) attempt to insult me, and your apparent reading comprehension isn't what I would expect of a person who can figure out a way to combine two contemporary quasi-sardonist culture's most annoying cliches while simultaneously explaining each. But hey. The winky face at the end makes it all better.
