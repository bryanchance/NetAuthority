<P>I found a really stupid website. It's called <A HREF="http://www.netauthority.org">http://www.netauthority.org</A> . Here's my e-mail.
<BR><A HREF="mailto:palgrave@hotmail.com">palgrave@hotmail.com</A> . Anyway, this site thinks that they are really christian-like by going around and e-mailing people and threatening them with legal action (even if they have absolutely no case). For heaven's sake, they threatened Neal Boortz, the talk master, for distributing hate speach.
