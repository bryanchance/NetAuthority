<P>in the meta tags to your site the description reads "The official governing body of the internet".
<BR>i find this extremely difficult to believe. if this is false as i believe, then i was wondering if your god advocates such duplicity?
<BR>i can understand your desire to increase the number of hits to this site, but at the expense of your honesty????
