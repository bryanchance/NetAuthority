<P>> Either these people are dead serious or they

I think it's hilarious and I'm gonna add all my friends to their database. And if you don't think people can be bored enough to do something like this, have you ever seen THE REALLY BIG BUTTON THAT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING, or one of the many, many spam (tm) related pages? Besides, do you think an ultra-conservative neo-fascist site would actually HAVE a forum??
