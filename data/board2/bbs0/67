<P>> Let He who is without sin cast the first
<BR>> stone.
<P>> This is what I have said. It is The Word. It
<BR>> shall be so.
<P>> Thy claim to see through My eyes. This an
<BR>> afront to my name. How dare anyone say to
<BR>> know the mind of God. I have given thee My
<BR>> Word and My Love and nothing more. Obey My
<BR>> Word, spread My Word, Only I shall enforce
<BR>> The Word.
<P>> Attempt to become the hand of God and ye
<BR>> shall feel My Hand. The shepard shall tend
<BR>> only the flock, I shall tend all else. Let
<BR>> not thyn ego become too bold and assume thyn
<BR>> be as Great and Wise as I. Twas the folly of
<BR>> My First Angel, let it not be thyn folly as
<BR>> well. This is My only warning to thee.
<P>> Understand that I am everything. I am even
<BR>> that which thy now seek to destroy. Thy can
<BR>> understand only by releasing thyn own
<BR>> motives from My Word. Blessed are those who
<BR>> heed My Word. Blessed are those who teach My
<BR>> Word. Foolish are those who bend My Word to
<BR>> thyn own will. If it exists in the Heavens
<BR>> or on Earth, then it is My Will, and My Will
<BR>> Alone. Thalt shalt not question that which
<BR>> is.
<P>> I have moved through this mortal to bring
<BR>> you My Word. Rejoice in the recieving of My
<BR>> Wisdom.
<P>> My face moveth apon the shores and apon the
<BR>> deep. I am the Alpha and the Omega. This is
<BR>> The Word of the Lord. It shall be.
<BR>
