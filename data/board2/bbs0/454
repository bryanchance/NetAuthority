<P>Background:
<P>Laura Schlessinger is a US radio personality who dispenses
<BR>advice to people who call in to her radio show. Recently,
<BR>she said that to an observant Orthodox Jew,
<BR>homosexuality is an abominaton according to
<BR>Leviticus 18:22 and cannot be condoned in any circumstance.
<P>The following is an open letter to Dr. Laura penned by a US resident and
<BR>also posted on the Internet:-
<P>Dear Dr. Laura:
<P>Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding
<BR>God's Law. I have learned a great deal from your show, and
<BR>I try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can.
<BR>When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle,
<BR>for example, I simply remind them that Leviticus
<BR>18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination.
<BR>End of debate.
<P>I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some of the specific
<BR>laws and how to follow them.
<P>a) When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know
<BR>it creates a pleasing odour for the Lord (Lev. 1:9).
<BR>The problem is my neighbours. They claim the odour is not pleasing to them.
<BR>Should I smite them?
<P>b) I would like to sell my daughter into slavery,
<BR>as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7.
<BR>In this day and age, what do you think would be a
<BR>fair price for her?
<P>c) I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while
<BR>she is in her period of menstrual uncleanliness (Lev. 15:19-24).
<BR>The problem is, how do I tell?
<BR>I have tried asking, but most women take offence.
<P>d) Lev. 25:44 states that I may indeed possess slaves, both
<BR>male and female, provided they are purchased from neighbouring nations. A
<BR>friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians.
<BR>Can you clarify?
<BR>Why can't I own Canadians?
<P>e) I have a neighbour who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2
<BR>clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him
<BR>myself?
<P>f) A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is
<BR>an abomination (Lev. 11:10), it is a lesser abomination than
<BR>homosexuality. I don't agree. Can you settle this?
<P>g) Lev. 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God
<BR>if I have a defect in my sight.
<BR>I have to admit that I wear reading glasses.
<BR>Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here?
<P>h) Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including
<BR>the hair around their temples,
<BR>even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev.19:27.
<BR>How should they die?
<P>i) I know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead
<BR>pig makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves?
<P>j) My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev. 19:19 by planting
<BR>two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing
<BR>garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend).
<BR>He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to
<BR>all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them?
<BR>(Lev.24:10-16) Couldn't we just burn them to death at a private family affair like we
<BR>do with people who sleep with their in-laws? (Lev. 20:14)
<P>I know you have studied these things extensively, so I am
<BR>confident you can help.
<BR>Thank you again for reminding us that God's word is eternal and
<BR>unchanging. Your devoted disciple and adoring fan.
