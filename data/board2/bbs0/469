<P>Except for this forum, all the web pages on this site are static. Even the page reporting the total entries in the databases is not computer generated. If this organisation maintains the database it claims, the page must be manually updated. Considering the size of the world population and number of websites, this is absurd. Anybody who would know enough to obtain their own domain and web server would know better than this.
<P>It is not possible to view the databases. If the organisation wanted to reduce undesirable filth, they would try to name and shame people and websites and tell parents not to let their children near them. What will this organisation do with a private list? Spam the webmasters? Why ask to collect filthy website URLs and people, check them out and then do nothing?
<P>The organisation does not mention their members nor their churches (they are clearly christian). A collection of self-righteous, bible-bashers not proclaim their community? That's a first.
<P>As for the example in their FAQ, 'Jody' might get violent with 'Ray'? Men intimidating women with physical violence is far more likely. Conservative, christian societies are not known for their aggressive women. Even matriarchs use tongue-lashing, not violence. Why would a conservative writer think of a woman threatening a man, rather than the other way round? And men take far more interest in porn than women. And the database can't be viewed, so how would 'Jody' ever know?
<P>For these reasons I believe this site is either a daft joke or a research project. The whois database for this domain it down. Ignore this site. Anybody know of any self-righteous, moralist groups that I can be banned by?
