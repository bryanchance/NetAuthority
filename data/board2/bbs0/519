<P>If it is a hoax they went out of their way to pull it off, I found out about it after they harassed several other sites (www.paul-rocks.org and <A HREF="http://www.angelfire.com/goth/retards/index.html">www.angelfire.com/goth/retards/index.html</A> for example). I hope this site is a hoax, because these people seem like total fanatics.
<P>> Didn't your mother ever tell you not to
<BR>> believe everything your read? Amazing how
<BR>> pissed off people get though..... very
<BR>> nicely done prank.
