<P>I wholeheartedly agree.
<P>It is not OUR responsibility to filter and restrict what your children see on the internet, just as it is not our responsibility to filter and restrict the magazines they read or the television shows they watch.
<P>The internet is simply another form of broadcast media. Much like anyone can put up a webpage, so can pretty much anyone start up a small magazine, newspaper, or local cable access television show. It is all the same principle.
<P>Everyone has the right to express their opinion or post what they like. While I will admit there are some sites out there I would not mind seeing closed, I'm not going to crusade and persecute the owners of the sites. Variety is the spice of life, but I can choose just how much spice I want.
<P>Why not explain to your children what sites you'd prefer they not look at and install a NetNanny on your computer? Present it to them logically rather than persecuting people for posting what they want to post. Think! I am not here to think about your children; YOU are here to think about your children. You are your child's keeper, not me.
<P>If I were to see a site I deemed unsuitable for my children, I would simply and respectfully ask them not to view it, then explain why. Properly raised children will understand the logic of this. You cannot shelter your children forever. But you can help them understand your point of view. Educate! Don't censor! Limiting them without explanation only encourages rebellion.
<P>This site does nothing but foster narrowmindedness, ignorance, and censorship in its drive to stamp out selfexpression. If you consider it you will see it. Sites like this are what gives Christians a poor reputation. Do bear in mind that you are not here to pass judgement on other humans. God will do that.
<P>I can't help but think of Revelation when I review your views; remember that in the End Times it is purported that the Antichrist will control all media. You don't want to be likened to the AntiChrist, do you?
<P>
