<P>> I really think they're serious. They sent me
<BR>> an email threatening to "take
<BR>> action" against my site if I don't
<BR>> clean it up.
<P>I don't know. I can't find it right now, but somewhere on the site there is a quote that goes something like "We hope to clean the internet of everyting that would corrupt our children" and then goes on to say "Let's make the internet of the future the internet of today!". Now, either they're the most psychotic and schizophrenic people on the face of the planet, or it's not real.
