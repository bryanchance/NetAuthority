<P>> Notice the link counter at the bottom of all
<BR>> the pages. It's obviously a ploy to generate
<BR>> hits. The guy is probably making money from
<BR>> the hits in some way. The best way to
<BR>> generate hits is to start a giant flame war.
<P>> Looks like he's playing us all for pawns.
<BR>> Nice moves actually.
<P>Gotta agree guy - had us both going at each other's throats while driving up the hits LOL
<BR>(Thumper-Bunny get it? LOL)
<BR>I think it's 'RageBoy' they guy's a fucking genius (quite literally, which is surprising since he lives in Boulder, CO. known for it's free thinking - as long as you think along *their* lines - kinda like the 'diversity' fascists)! And from what I read of him and from him he has the time and the money to pull shit like this just for the grins.
<P>Keep the posts coming people this is just too great!
<BR>
