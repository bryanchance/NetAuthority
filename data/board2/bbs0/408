<P>Thank you for taking a stand against all that
<BR>is ungodly and sinful. I know many people will
<BR>burn in hell for the things have done, particularly the indecent obscene sex they are having all the time.
<P>Now, if you could only make sure that
<BR>people are punished by the sword of righteousness, they would not dare mock the Lord anymore!
<P>
