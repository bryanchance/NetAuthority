<P>I can't understand why someone would create such a stupid site. Now who the hell gives you the right to force your religion on other people. Let me guess, god. Damned Canadians. That's the problem with you people, you are so igonorant of other peoples beliefs, and principals - you're willing to sacrifice your own morales to scare people with a hoax. What if others view the type of conduct they display as appropriate. What makes you the perfect arbitor to decide that they're wrong and you know it because you're just looking out for the betterment of the internet. What if I were to say your flagrant display of religious beliefs is offending to the jews or the muslims. Or the budhists or the prodestines, or the countless other religions.
<P>So get this. You are in violation of the Common Sense Authority(commonsense.org). I hearby decre that this site is blasphemous in the eyes of the mongolian religion. You must cease this incessant display of falsified religios beliefs immediately, or we shall contact ranger joe of the Canadian local authorities. To continue this site would make you a sinner, and thereby damn you to hell.
<P>Here Here
<P>P.S. If certain viewpoints offend you, and I mean you individualy, than by all means block it out with net nanny or something - but please dont force bullshit on others. I hope Canada isn't turning into a Communist nation, whom tells their citizens what they can and can't express.
