<P>This site is a bad joke - the Internet exists as it is, so get used to it. It will not be dumbed down to the level where your kids will be allowed to happily skip anywhere, just like the streets of New York city will not be cleaned up just because you think kids should be able to play there at 2 am.
<P>If you want your kids to be "safe" (and whether they're safe being raised by small minded cowards like you is a ripe topic) then supervise their net access yourself. We're not going to change our sites for your benefit.
<P>Welcome to the real world.
