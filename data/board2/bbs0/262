<P>Come on buddy, you can't be serious! First off hide your incompetancy by fixing your spelling errors.
<BR>Next, consider that 3/4's of the world is NON-Christian, and that you by the following statement:
<BR>"Quote"
<P>General Blashemy
<P>Blasphemic content is any material that is seen as sin through the eyes of our Lord. It is expected that all Internet users familiarize themselves with The Bible. Ignorance is no excuse! If you are involved with the distribution of, or obtain in any fashion material that is considered offensive, then you are in violation of the NA-AIUG.
<P>"End Quote"
<P>insinuate that they are condemned because they likely will not read your Bible- like who wants to anyways? It is a story told by illiterates embellished over the years, with no scientific proof of accuracy, subject to dramatically diverse interpretations. Even those in your own Christian community cannot agree amongst yourselves within maybe 20% of the content. Why, if there is ONE GOD, are there are 5,000 some odd Christian religions? I'll give you my take on it:
<P>Religion is a Power grab! Pure and simple. Very few of the "lofty" ideals that are touted by most Bible Thumpers (and other religions' equivalents) are ever adhered to. Not because man is not pure and is some sort of dirty beast that can never hope to attain some level of decency in the eyes of "their Lord" - whichever flavour of the week it is. It is used to maintain control over a semi willing populace and is a plague on the Golden Rule - which we (and I ) live by, and is a guilt- ridden desperation attempt to make the average persons' life miserable. You go to church and the first thing out of the mouth of some authority is "you are a sinner! Repent! Guilt Guilt Guilt!" THis is supposed to make you feel good about yourself, your community, your family? It is supposed to give you "faith" that humandkind is even worthy of "rescue"? There you go, in a nutshell. Religion is doomed to failure as an experiment that mankind has grown out of, and is part of a past that those that have used for their own personal gain should be ashamed of. Just look at the crimes committed by men and women of the cloth against ( especially) defenseless children, and the assaulting they perform weekly on our souls merely to justify their existence. Would you consider the Vatican a "saintly" organisation? Of course not! They are as rife with corruptness as the next "ministry". The church is infested with hypocrites, and the poor few souls that go head strong into these religions get sucked in, losing their wealth, personality, and self worth, all for the indignity of constantly assaulting others into being made to feel guilt and making their lives more miserable.
<P>I am not saying that there is NO good work done by Christians- there obviously is. However, I would suggest that a heavy percentage that is done as "good" is done for other reasons, and usually that "help" is done at a price tag- that being pressure to convert to Christianity, or their particular religious sect- be it Catholic, Protestant, or Hare Krishna!
<P>So in the end the thinking man looks back at the joke that has been played upon him by these religious leaders and says to him/herself "Do I feel like going to church today?" and the next question is "what do I get out of it?" and in the end the realistic answer is "a lot of mental abuse, ridicule, deprication, and boring speakers droning on and on about how bad I am" hmmm...
<P>"Naw. I think I'll go to see the Mariners play baseball!"
<P>Here is something for you to chew on:
<P>"Quote"
<P>Hate Literature
<P>Hate literature entails any media that indicates, direct or implied, one group of persons' superiority over another. This includes, but is not limited to, written material, photographs, rendered images, and multimedia presentations. The groups can be categorized by race, religious beliefs, skin color, association, or any delimiter that specifies distinct separation of on group of persons from another. If you distrubite, read, aid in the digital transfer of, or are related in any way to hate literature as defined above, you are in violation of the NA-AIUG."

<P>By your own definition YOUR site is Offensive, and should be at the top of this list of offenders as it violates the very rules you set forth as against the "code". By NOT being a bible thumping biblical scholar Christian, you insinuate that one is less superior. Can you say "HYPOCRITE" ?
<P>I don't even need to go into your interracial diatribes as you evidently are so blind you cannot see that you are once again discriminating by race!
<P>Sheesh! OPEN your eyes, and SEE the light!
