<P>Praise the Lord that someone is finally going to CLEAN UP this mess
<BR>called the Internet!! Too long have pornographers, blasphemers,
<BR>satanists, and the mass hoardes of the UnGodly who are found wanting in
<BR>the eyes of Christ had their way with the wonderful technology of the
<BR>Internet with which the Lord has seen fit to gift us.
<P>Governments, technologists, and policy makers DO NOT realize the real
<BR>DANGER that perversion of the Internet presents to our children and to
<BR>the health and morality of our Great Nation, and if your victory is
<BR>complete (and I pray daily for your victory), you MUST see that the
<BR>these offenders of Internet morality are PUT TO DEATH by the sword or by
<BR>the stone, as prescribed in Our Lord's Holy Word.
<P>We must remain as True Believers and be zealous in our prosecution of
<BR>the unrighteous, even unto death. Those who oppose us will burn
<BR>eternally in HELL where their pain and suffering will be righteous
<BR>retribution for the suffering and delusion they have imposed upon God's
<BR>true children here on Earth.
<P>In Christ,
<BR>Rev. Lynn C. Doyle
