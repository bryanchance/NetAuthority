<P>> Actually these people are doing a fantastic
<BR>> job of maintaining the illusion that they're
<BR>> serious, with only the slightest hints that
<BR>> they're joking, but apparently enough to
<BR>> fool SOME people. I think it's hilarious and
<BR>> I'm gonna add all my friends to their
<BR>> database. And if you don't think people can
<BR>> be bored enough to do something like this,
<BR>> have you ever seen THE REALLY BIG BUTTON
<BR>> THAT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING, or one of the
<BR>> many, many spam (tm) related pages? Besides,
<BR>> do you think an ultra-conservative
<BR>> neo-fascist site would actually HAVE a
<BR>> forum??
<P>I didn't say they were serious, I just said that if its a joke then its a pretty pointless, stupid one.
<BR>
