<P>> Hate Literature
<BR>>
<BR>> Hate literature entails any
<BR>> media that indicates,
<BR>> direct or implied, one
<BR>> group of persons'
<BR>> superiority over another.
<P>You're sending this type of letter yourself to complain about people who you consider to be blasphemers!
<P>If I say "Allah is the one true God", then you either have to accept that I'm entitled to my own religious beliefs - or send a bigotted letter of religious hatred to my ISP.
<P>I don't like your superior attetude. Under the terms of your own blurb about "hate literature", you should belong quite firmly in your own database.
<P>Go screw yourselves quite firmly up the arse, you moralistic pillocks. The time and money which you've spent putting your pathetically thought-out site together would have been better spent opening the eyes of your children to multi-culturalism and to get on with children from other ways of life.
