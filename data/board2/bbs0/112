<P>> Yes, NetAuthority, thank you very much for
<BR>> providing such a useful service. It's about
<BR>> time someone did something. I've not seen as
<BR>> much unholiness in my entire life as I have
<BR>> since I've been online these past few
<BR>> months.
<P>> *Remember, netauthority.org. these are the
<BR>> sinners that are objecting to such a useful
<BR>> service. God rewards those who are faithful
<BR>> in times of temptation.
<P>Ahmen to that! Keep up the good work! You guys are moving in the right direction... and may the rest of you burn in the depths of satans ass.
<BR>
